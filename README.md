THE COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS
Our Founders formed Aurox LLC in 2018 to develop the company’s technology and on November 30, 2021, we
incorporated Aurox Holdings Inc., a C Corporation incorporated under the laws of Nevada to continue to advance our
all-in-one cryptocurrency terminal.
Our executive offices are located at 4514 Cole Avenue, Suite 600, Dallas, TX 75205, and our telephone number is
(888) 385-3401. Our website address is https://getaurox.com/.
We have not incorporated by reference into this offering memorandum the information included on or linked from our
website, and you should not consider it to be part of this Form C filing.
Overview
Aurox was originally created by traders for traders to make investing in crypto simple. Today, our mission is to make
crypto simple and accessible to everyone.
Since 2018, the Aurox brand’s goal has been to make crypto easy for professional and beginner traders through an
integrated all-in-one solution: the Aurox Terminal, which aggregates data, provides Proprietary Indicators and
simplifies decentralized finance (DeFi). We set out to create a more unique and immersive interface for not just
experienced traders, but for beginners as well.
Our ecosystem of products, including the Aurox Terminal and the Aurox Wallet are seeking to accelerate decentralized
finance (DeFi) adoption by integrating low-cost, fast-executing trading and offering a stable, scalable, tested and
unique infrastructure. The Aurox Wallet browser extension launched on December 1st and the iOS version is expected
to be released by the end of January, 2023. An additional aspect of our Ecosystem is the Aurox Token, a utility token
designed to enhance the user’s experience within the Aurox Ecosystem.
The Aurox Terminal was created to solve the major problems with cryptocurrency investing such as unwieldy multiexchange environment, fragmented data, and lack of trader-specific tools. The Aurox Terminal offers an all-in-one
trading platform that incorporates data from over 50 exchanges, provides in excess of 100,000 Pairs, offers Proprietary
Indicators, and customizable workspaces and guides to help traders make smart and informed trades. Since its 2020
launch, the Aurox Terminal has quickly grown from just a few hundred beta users to over 70,000 users today.
The Aurox Terminal accommodates users with existing accounts at centralized hubs such as Coinbase, Binance, and
Crypto.com, among others, by allowing them to link those accounts to the Aurox Terminal. Once linked, these users
can utilize their accounts for executing trades through the Aurox Terminal. In addition, users can link their existing
Web3 wallets to the Aurox Terminal to access thousands of crypto assets available through third party DEXes, such
as Uniswap. Aurox’s ability to accommodate both centralized and decentralized transactions can facilitate users’
transition away from their centralized hubs and toward DeFi transactions.
We have accomplished this by leveraging all the positives of DeFi with our highly scalable and data-rich backend
platform that powers the Aurox Terminal. The Aurox Wallet, a non-custodial Web3 browser extension and mobile
application wallet with DeFi capabilities, also integrates the same backend platform to create a simple, intuitive and
customer centric DeFi experience. Between the Aurox Wallet and the Aurox Terminal, the Aurox Ecosystem creates
a simple way for users to control their funds, execute trades across multiple decentralized exchanges and interact with
decentralized Protocols. Additionally, the Aurox Token is a utility token that amplifies the capability of the Aurox
Protocol and Aurox Wallet by incentivizing trade activity, increasing liquidity, and facilitating community governance.
Aurox Ecosystem
The Aurox Ecosystem seeks to simplify investing, trading and, eventually, lending, and is arranged into three main
segments: Aurox Frontend, Aurox Backend and Aurox Protocol.
2
Aurox Frontend
The Aurox Frontend is composed of two separate products: the Aurox Terminal, and the Aurox Wallet. All of our
products are non-custodial, meaning that we do not store or hold any cryptocurrency on behalf of the user.
 The Aurox Terminal – an all-in-one cryptocurrency terminal licensed from Aurox, LLC, a company
owned and controlled by the Founders. The platform integrates 50+ exchanges, over 100,000 Pairs,
and our advanced Proprietary Indicators to help crypto traders make better investment decisions.
The Aurox Trading Platform allows users to link their existing exchange account(s), or wallet(s),
and execute orders directly from the Platform.
 The Aurox Wallet – a non-custodial Web3 browser extension and mobile application wallet with
DeFi capabilities. Both the extension and the mobile application are designed to make DeFi simple,
but the mobile application is designed for a broad audience whereas the extension is for the DeFi
enthusiast demographic. The user can install the wallet extension on any major browser or install
the mobile version on iOS and Android. It allows users to (i) hold funds in a decentralized wallet;
(ii) invest and trade on decentralized exchanges; and, as we develop the respective functionalities,
(iii) interact with a multitude of DeFi protocols, such as liquidity mining, lending, staking, etc.
Aurox Backend
The Aurox Terminal and Aurox Wallet are underpinned by our backend technology which connects our users to both
centralized services and the Blockchain. The Aurox backend gathers massive amounts of data and delivers it at fast
speeds to the end user. Our backend is currently being utilized by tens of thousands of users. Our powerful, elegant
and scalable backend will power our entire suite of tools: the Terminal, and the Aurox Wallet.
Aurox Protocol
The Aurox Protocol is the heart of the Aurox Ecosystem. Our Protocol is a complex set of contracts that powers a
simplified, streamlined end-user experience. Our vision is that Aurox will be the system where every single asset can
be invested in and traded with a single click of a button. To support this, our Protocol will, ultimately, aggregate all
tokens across every single chain and allow a user to purchase in any token using any other token on the market.
Aurox Opportunity
The rapid growth and adoption of decentralized finance (DeFi) around the world provides a critical tailwind supporting
Aurox’s growth. According to Grandview Research, the global decentralized finance market size was valued at USD
11.78 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 42.5% from 2022 to 2030.1
The Blockchain technology segment dominated the global industry in 2021 and accounted for the largest share of
more than 41.35% of the overall decentralized revenue.2 Blockchain technology can enable the emergence of
decentralized financial services, replacing the existing centralized business model foundations by lowering transaction
costs, fostering distributed trust, and empowering associated decentralized platforms.
Over the last five years, the DeFi sector experienced tremendous growth, and has now reached a critical user mass
allowing for rapid adoption through the adoption curve.3

The broader cryptocurrency market has experienced incredible growth in both assets and market value. Based on
Statista data, the number of crypto assets has grown from a mere handful in 2013 to nearly 10,400 by early 2020.4
The aggregate market capitalization of all crypto assets has also experienced expansive growth, as well as volatility:
from just under $200 billion in January 2020 to approximately $2.9 trillion by November 2021, before falling to less
than $1.0 trillion in June 2022.5
Along with this increase in crypto assets, the number of centralized and decentralized platforms available to consumers,
investors, and businesses has proliferated.6
 These platforms seek to offer the ability to engage in an ever-changing
variety of financial and non-financial activities.
While features of crypto-asset projects and technologies vary significantly, the use of Blockchain technology has
reduced the need for intermediaries, including the possibility to facilitate secure transfers of value between parties
without the use of a mutually trusted third party. The Blockchain may produce future benefits associated with faster
settlement of financial transactions; new financial products; and direct access to asset networks by individual
consumers, investors, and businesses.
We believe our customer base will grow alongside the ecosystem we serve as we continue to support more asset
classes and add more features to our platform. Relative to adoption levels for the broader crypto space, the market for
DeFi appears highly underpenetrated with about 6.7 million total users as of early 2023.7
In comparison, Coinbase – a single centralized exchange, and not even the largest – had 98M total users and 8.8M
monthly active users in 2021, suggesting there’s a long way for DeFi to grow.8
At the same time, DeFi asset deployment – though fast-growing – is a mere fraction of the broader crypto space, with
about 45.5 billion in total value locked as of January 2023, down for a peak around 150 billion.9
Our objective is to bring crypto-based financial services to anyone with a smartphone or a computer, a population of
approximately 6 billion people today.10
Revenue Model
In the near term, Aurox expects to generate revenue through the following channels:
 DeFi (decentralized finance) order routing and smart contract interaction: The main revenue source
for the company will be through order routing via their decentralized smart contracts, the Aurox
Protocol. All flagship products (Aurox Terminal and Aurox Wallet) will utilize a set of smart
contracts to properly route orders to existing on-chain liquidity. These products will simplify the
process while minimizing user costs. Aurox expects to charge a fee of approximately 0.3% for orders
facilitated through the platforms.

 Subscription services: The Aurox Terminal will include several subscription-based products such
as educational courses, auto trading bots, Proprietary Indicators and other software services where
users will be charged on a monthly basis. Additionally, the company will be initiating a subscription
service tailored for businesses and crypto funds wherein the company sells chart data, analytics, and
additional platform data, excluding all user-specific data, for businesses to tap into to monitor the
market in real time.
In the future, Aurox expects to expand its portfolio of offerings to include solutions for both lending and margin
products, which will generate the following additional channels of revenue:
 Entry fees to educational trading competitions: The Aurox Terminal will have sit-and-go type
tournaments where users can enter to compete one another in short and long-term trading
competitions. Users will be able to compete against a small group of 5-10 other users where each
user starts the competition with fake/paper money. At the end of the allotted time, the users with
the most money will be declared winners. The goal of this competition is to educate the average
trader by mimicking real life situations, where there is more risk and anxiety during trading.
 Margin Fees: Aurox will also provide value for decentralized margin traders, and charge 10% of the
value of the margin fee paid by borrowers, with the rest of the fee accruing to lenders to allow for
robust yields to that customer base.
Competitive Strengths
Aurox competes with other cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology businesses and other potential financial
vehicles. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond our control, may make it more attractive for
investors to invest in other financial vehicles, or to invest in cryptocurrencies directly which could adversely impact
Aurox’s business. Aurox’s main competitors include: TradingView, MetaMask, and 1inch.
Aurox distinguishes itself by offering users the following:
 Simple user experience: The Aurox Terminal is an all-in-one crypto-trading platform that makes it
simple for first-time and advanced users to trade cryptocurrencies. The Aurox Wallet, accessible
through both a browser and mobile, will make it easier for users to trade and hold cryptocurrencies
in a non-custodial manner. The Aurox Wallet will also allow users to interact with decentralized
applications with a single click of a button.
 Affordability: Unlike other competitors in the marketplace, the Aurox Terminal is free to use and
does not charge users an additional fee for personalizing workspaces or integrating specific market
indicators. The Aurox Wallet will optimize order routing and allow users to make investments with
the lowest cost basis.
 Enhanced security: The Aurox Wallet will include enhanced security features to protect users and
their capital - with the goal of making decentralized investing as simple and straight-forward as
centralized investing. Features include, first and foremost, a simple, streamlined user experience
that works to limit user errors, transaction simulation to protect from scams in real time, and
whitelist of smart contracts, e.g. - code that works to identify, and block known scams.
Growth Strategy
We believe we have a tremendous opportunity to actively drive our business by:
 Adding more users. Any person or business with an internet connection or mobile device that is
looking to access or interact with the cryptoeconomy can be an active user and customer on our
platform. We intend to add more customers by expanding and growing our platform and Ecosystem.
5
 Expanding asset depth and breadth. Any asset or form of value can be represented as a crypto asset
and be supported on our platform, subject to meeting our security, legal, and compliance
requirements. We plan to expand the depth and breadth of assets offered.
 Launching innovative products. Any known, and many yet-to-be-created, financial and nonfinancial products can be built for the cryptoeconomy. We will continue to innovate by providing
customers more opportunities to engage with crypto by developing and launching innovative
products and services across our platform.
Company Contemplated Milestones for 2023:
The company expects to continue developing the Aurox Wallet, Aurox Trade and Aurox Terminal, as follows:
Research and Development (Current Development Stage and Future Roadmap)
The company does not perform pure research and development. The company spends expenses on creating technically
feasible products. All research and development is part of the entire development process to create final products.
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
The company cautions that current global uncertainty with respect to the spread of COVID-19 and its effect on the
broader global economy may have a significant negative effect on the company. While the precise impact of the
COVID-19 virus on the company remains unknown, rapid spread of COVID-19 may have a material adverse effect
on global economic activity and can result in volatility and disruption to global supply chains, operations, mobility of
people and the financial markets, which could affect interest rates, credit ratings, credit risk, inflation, business,
financial conditions, results of operations and other factors relevant to the company.
Going Concern
The Report of our Independent Registered Public Accountant firm issued in connection with our audited consolidated
financial statement for the transition period ended March 31, 2022 expresses substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. The company had an accumulated deficit of $473,423 on March 31, 2022. In order to
obtain the necessary capital to sustain operations, management’s plans include, among other things, the possibility of

pursuing new equity sales and/or making additional debt borrowings. There can be no assurances, however, that we
will be successful in obtaining additional financing, or that such financing will be available on favorable terms, if at
all. If we are unable to obtain financing in the amounts and on terms deemed acceptable, the business and future
success may be adversely affected, and we may cease operations.
Summary Risk Factors
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:
 We are an early-stage company with a limited operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate
our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk of your investment.
 Our operating results have and will significantly fluctuate due to the highly volatile nature of crypto.
 The cryptocurrency industry in which we operate is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility,
depending on a number of factors, including regulatory and legislative changes as well as market
developments that could adversely impact our business.
 We operate in a highly competitive industry, and we compete against unregulated companies and
companies with greater financial and other resources, and our business, operating results, and
financial condition may be adversely affected if we are unable to respond to our competitors
effectively.
 Competition in our industry could intensify, which could adversely affect our revenue, profitability
and market share.
 The future development and growth of crypto is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to
predict and evaluate. If crypto does not grow as we expect, our business, operating results, and
financial condition could be adversely affected.
 We compete against a growing number of decentralized and noncustodial platforms and our business
may be adversely affected if we fail to compete effectively against them.
Our failure to successfully execute our business plan, maintain and expand our operations, and invest in our business
could require us to seek additional capital.
 The company may not be able to successfully develop and promote new products or services which
could result in adverse financial consequences.
 The company may fail to anticipate or adapt to technology innovations in a timely manner, or at all.
The company’s business and operation could be negatively affected by any material litigation involving the company
or any subsidiaries that the Company may form.
 Litigation is costly and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on our business,
results or operations and reputation.
 We are subject to an extensive and highly evolving regulatory landscape and any adverse changes
to, or our failure to comply with, any laws and regulations could adversely affect our brand,
reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.
There is no active public trading market for our Common Stock, and we cannot assure you that an active trading
market will develop in the near future.
7
 Our financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis and our continued operations
are in doubt.
 We are dependent on certain key personnel, the loss of which may adversely affect our financial
condition or results of operations.
Any valuation at this stage is difficult to assess and the valuation for this offering was established by the company.
Unlike listed companies that are valued publicly through market-driven stock prices, the valuation of private
companies, especially startups, is difficult to assess and you may risk overpaying for your investment.
Cyberattacks and security breaches of our platform, or those impacting our customers or third parties, could adversely
impact our brand and reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.
 The company’s compliance and risk management programs may not be effective and may result in
outcomes that could materially and adversely affect the company’s reputation, financial condition
and operating results, among other things.
Operational risks, such as misconduct and errors of employees or entities with which the company does business, are
difficult to detect and deter and could cause material reputational and financial harm to the company.
 The company’s use of proprietary and non-proprietary software, data and intellectual property may
be subject to substantial risk.
 Unauthorized computer infiltration, denial-of-service attacks, phishing efforts, unauthorized access,
malicious software codes, computer viruses or other such harmful computer campaigns may
negatively impact our business causing significant disruptions to our business operations.
 The company’s use of proprietary and non-proprietary software, data and intellectual property may
be subject to substantial risk.
 Unauthorized computer infiltration, denial-of-service attacks, phishing efforts, unauthorized access,
malicious software codes, computer viruses or other such harmful computer campaigns may
negatively impact our business causing significant disruptions to our business operations.
 The emergence of a novel coronavirus on a global scale, known as COVID-19, and related
geopolitical events could continue to lead to increased market volatility, disruption to U.S. and world
economies and markets has and may continue to have significant adverse effects on the company.
Employees
The company currently has twelve (12) full-time employees and eleven (11) contract employees. The full-time
employees are in charge of spearheading development, while the contract employees help increase the time it takes to
roll-out products.
The company currently spends approximately $150,000 monthly on its twelve (12) full-time employees and
approximately $50,000 on contractors. Since Aurox is on a strict timeline to release working products, the contractors
will be slowly phased out to help minimize expenses now that the main products have been released.
Regulation
The regulation of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets continues to evolve in every jurisdiction, and governmental,
regulatory and other changes or actions may restrict the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, the operation of
distributed ledger technologies that support such cryptocurrencies and platforms that facilitate the trading of such
assets and provide certain services in connection with such assets.
8
Intellectual Property
Aurox Holdings, Inc. does not own any patents or trademarks. The company is currently exploring various filings to
protect its intellectual property.
Litigation
From time to time, the company may be involved in various legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of
business. The company currently is not aware of legal proceedings or claims that it believes it will have, individually
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows.
Property
The company leases a virtual office from Regus Management that provides Aurox with mail service, telephone
answering, and other amenities. All employees for the company work remotely around the U.S. and globally.
Due Diligence
Due diligence by tZERO Markets, LLC, a SEC-registered broker-dealer and member of FINRA and SIPC.

9
RISK FACTORS
The SEC requires the company to identify risks that are specific to its business and its financial condition. The
company is still subject to all the same risks that all companies in its business, and all companies in the economy, are
exposed to. These include risks relating to economic downturns, political and economic events and technological
developments (such as hacking and the ability to prevent hacking). Additionally, early-stage companies are inherently
more risky than more developed companies. You should consider general risks as well as specific risks when deciding
whether to invest.
Primary Risks Related to Our Business
We are an early-stage company with a limited operating history in a rapidly evolving industry, which makes it
difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be
successful.
The company is a relatively new business, and as such it faces challenges on a number of fronts, including attracting
and retaining qualified employees, designing and implementing new business systems, technology systems, marketing,
and capital formation. Failure by the company in respect of any of these areas could adversely impact your investment.
At the same time, we have not generated any revenues as of the date hereof and our limited operating history may
make it difficult to evaluate our current business and our future prospects. We may encounter risks and difficulties
frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly developing and changing industries, including challenges in
forecasting accuracy, determining appropriate investments of our limited resources, market acceptance of our existing
and future solutions, managing customer implementations and developing new solutions. Our current operating model
may require changes in order for us to achieve profitability and scale our operations efficiently. For example, we may
need to enhance our products and product delivery to allow us to efficiently and cost-effectively develop and
implement new programs, make our products easy to implement, ensure our marketing strategy is designed to drive
highly qualified leads cost-effectively and implement changes in our sales model to improve the predictability of our
sales and reduce our sales cycle. If we fail to implement these changes on a timely basis or are unable to implement
them due to factors beyond our control, our business may suffer.
You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we face as an early-stage company.
We have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow, and we will need to raise additional funds to finance
operations, diluting your prospective investment.
We have a history of operating losses and negative cash flow. We have incurred recurring net losses, including net
losses from operations before income taxes of $473,423 for the period from November 30, 2021 (inception) through
March 31, 2022. We used $275,804 of cash for operating activities during the period from November 30, 2021
(inception) through March 31, 2022.
To support our existing and planned business model, we will need to raise additional capital to fund our future
operations. Our cash needs will depend on numerous factors, including our revenues, completion of our product
development activities, customer and market acceptance of our product, and our ability to reduce and control costs.
We expect to devote substantial capital resources to, among other things, fund operations and continue development
plans. If we are unable to secure such additional financing, it will have a material adverse effect on our business, and
we may have to limit operations. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities or convertible
debt securities, it will be dilutive to our stockholders and could result in a decrease in our stock price.
We have funded our operations with proceeds from private offerings of our Common Stock. Our history of operating
losses and cash uses, our projections of the level of cash that will be required for our operations to reach profitability,
the terms of the private placement transactions that we completed in the past, and any restricted availability of credit,
may impair our ability to raise capital on terms that we consider reasonable and at the levels that we will require over
the coming months. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding from public
10
or private offerings on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain the requisite amount of financing
needed to fund our planned operations, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.
We are a pre-revenue company, and may have limited access to capital aside from existing resources and future
capital raises
For the duration that the company remains pre-revenue, it will have limited access to additional capital aside from
existing cash and cash equivalents, as well as subsequent capital raises that the company may pursue. The company
does not have a commercial line of credit or similar facility and has no current plans to put one in place in the near
term.
There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
On March 31, 2022, the company had working capital in the amount of $3,589,523, and has incurred losses since
inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $573,423. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of the audited financial statements.
Through March 31, 2022, the company has raised gross proceeds in the amount of $4,825,000 from the sale of its
Common Stock. In order to meet its corporate and administrative expenses for the coming year, the company will be
required to raise funds through additional financing. Although the company has been successful in raising funds, there
is no certainty that the company will be successful in the future.
Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve sufficient profitable operations or become cash
flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We believe that our capital resources may be adequate to
continue operating and maintaining our business strategy for a period of twelve months following the offering, but we
may seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings and generate sufficient revenues to fund its
operations in the future.
We are highly dependent on the continued service of our Founders, whose financial interests may conflict with the
interests of investors.
Our founders, Giorgi Khazaradze, Taras Motsnyy and Ziga Naglic (collectively, the “Founders”), have years of
significant experience in sectors related to the company’s business, including software development, cryptocurrency
industries, Blockchain product development, engineering and research. Our success depends upon the continued
service of the Founders. Although the Founders have not yet executed employment agreements with the company as
of the date hereof, the company and the Founders are currently working to finalize their respective employment
agreements., Each of the Founders may terminate his relationship with the company at any time while maintaining
their entire ownership stake in the Common Stock and Series X Preferred Stock, which entitles the holder the right to
vote to the extent of 10x of the shares of Common Stock owned by them. The loss of any of our Founders might
significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives and could materially harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
Our operating results will significantly fluctuate due to the highly volatile nature of crypto, which also makes it
difficult to accurately predict our future performance.
Our sources of revenue will be dependent on the broader cryptoeconomy. Due to the highly volatile nature of the
cryptoeconomy and the prices of crypto assets, our operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter
in accordance with market sentiments and movements in the broader cryptoeconomy, many of which are unpredictable
and in certain instances are outside of our control, including (but not limited to):
 our dependence on crypto asset trading activity, including trading volume and the prevailing trading
prices for crypto assets, whose trading prices and volume can be highly volatile;
 our ability to attract, maintain, and grow our customer base and engage our customers;
11
 changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, or actions by governments or regulators,
including fines, orders, or consent decrees;
 regulatory changes that impact our ability to offer certain products or services;
 our ability to diversify and grow our subscription and services revenue;
 pricing for our products and services;
 investments we make in the development of products and services as well as technology offered to
our ecosystem partners, potential international expansion, and sales and marketing;
 adding and removing of crypto assets on our platform;
 macroeconomic conditions;
 adverse legal proceedings or regulatory enforcement actions, judgments, settlements, or other legal
proceeding and enforcement-related costs;
 the development and introduction of existing and new products and services by us or our competitors;
 increases in operating expenses that we expect to incur to grow and expand our operations and to
remain competitive;
 system failure or outages, including with respect to our crypto platform and third-party crypto
networks;
 breaches of security or privacy;
 inaccessibility of our platform due to our or third-party actions;
 our ability to attract and retain talent; and
 our ability to successfully adapt to competitive dynamics in our industry
As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast growth trends accurately, making our business and future
prospects difficult to evaluate, particularly in the short term. In view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business
and the cryptoeconomy, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful, and you should
not rely upon them as an indication of future performance. Quarterly and annual expenses reflected in our financial
statements may be significantly different from historical or projected rates. As a result, the trading price of our
Common Stock may increase or decrease significantly upon the completion of this offering.
Privacy regulations could have adverse consequences on our business.
We receive and process, but do not retain, store, or accrue, personal information and other user data. There are
numerous international, federal, and local laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security,
and the use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content, the scope of which are
changing, subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among countries, or conflict with other laws
and regulations. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and obligations to third parties related to
privacy, data protection, and information security. We strive to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies,
and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security to the extent possible.
However, the regulatory framework for privacy and data protection worldwide is, and is likely to remain for the
foreseeable future, uncertain and complex, and it is possible that these or other actual or alleged obligations may be
12
interpreted and applied in a manner that we do not anticipate or that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another
and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Further, any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or
industry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ data, or their
interpretation, or any changes regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the use or
disclosure of such data must be obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and features,
possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete, and may limit our ability to process user data or
develop new services and features.
We also expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data
protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. Any failure or perceived failure by
us to comply with our posted privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any
other legal obligations or regulatory requirements relating to privacy, data protection, or information security may
result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, claims, or public statements against us by
consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause our users to lose trust in us, and
otherwise have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other
burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to our users may limit the adoption and use
of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform.
Additionally, if third parties we work with violate applicable laws, regulations, or agreements, such violations may
put our users’ data at risk, could result in governmental investigations or enforcement actions, fines, litigation, claims,
or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could result in significant liability, cause
our users to lose trust in us, and otherwise have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Further, public
scrutiny of or complaints about technology companies or their data handling or data protection practices, even if
unrelated to our business, industry, or operations, may lead to increased scrutiny of technology companies, including
us, and may cause government agencies to enact additional regulatory requirements, or to modify their enforcement
or investigation activities, which may increase our costs and risks
Risks Related to Digital Assets, DeFi and the Cryptoeconomy
We expect that our revenue will be substantially dependent on the prices of crypto assets and volume of transactions
conducted on our platform. If such prices or volumes decline, our business, operating results, and financial
condition would be adversely affected.
We expect to generate a substantial portion of our total revenue from transaction fees on our platform in connection
with the purchase, sale, and trading of crypto assets by our users. While we are not an exchange, transaction fees,
which we expect to typically constitute a percentage of the value of each transaction, are expected to constitute
transaction revenue.
The price of crypto assets and associated demand for buying, selling, trading, lending and borrowing crypto assets
have historically been subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number of factors, including:
 market conditions across the cryptoeconomy;
 changes in liquidity, market-making volume, and trading activities;
 trading activities on other crypto platforms worldwide, many of which may be unregulated, and may
include manipulative activities;
 investment and trading activities of highly active retail and institutional users, speculators, miners,
and investors;
 the speed and rate at which crypto is able to gain adoption as a medium of exchange, utility, store
of value, consumptive asset, security instrument, or other financial assets worldwide, if at all;
13
 levels of user and investor confidence in crypto assets and crypto platforms, which can be impacted
by publicity, media coverage and social media sentiment, including the “trending” of certain crypto
assets
 the ability for crypto assets to meet user and investor demands;
 the functionality and utility of crypto assets and their associated ecosystems and networks, including
crypto assets designed for use in various applications;
 consumer preferences and perceived value of crypto assets and crypto asset markets;
 increased competition from other payment services or other crypto assets that exhibit better speed,
security, scalability, or other characteristics;
 regulatory or legislative changes and updates affecting the cryptoeconomy;
 the characterization of crypto assets under the laws of various jurisdictions around the world;
 the maintenance, troubleshooting, and development of the Blockchain networks underlying crypto
assets, including by miners, validators, and developers worldwide;
 the ability for crypto networks to attract and retain miners or validators to secure and confirm
transactions accurately and efficiently;
 ongoing technological viability and security of crypto assets and their associated smart contracts,
applications and networks, including vulnerabilities against hacks and scalability;
 fees and speed associated with processing crypto asset transactions, including on the underlying
Blockchain networks and on crypto platforms;
 financial strength of market participants;
 the availability and cost of funding and capital;
 the liquidity of crypto platforms;
 interruptions in service from or failures of major crypto platforms;
 availability of an active derivatives market for various crypto assets;
 availability of banking and payment services to support crypto-related projects;
 level of interest rates and inflation;
 monetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, and fiat currency devaluations; and
 national and international economic and political conditions.
There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of
trading activities. In the event that the price of crypto assets or the demand for trading crypto assets decline, our
business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.
DeFi is fast growing and rapidly evolving, creating the potential for new, novel and unforeseen risks
14
The company’s primary business and proposed revenue structure are highly dependent upon DeFi trading volumes.
DeFi is a recent innovation and emerging phenomenon that comes with many risks; it has not been stress tested by
long or widespread use, and not subject to traditional financial regulation and investor safeguards. The growth of DeFi
is likely to result in more extensive regulation. In addition, some of the risks of DeFi include:
 Limited consumer protections. Reflecting the nascent stage of DeFi development, DeFi rules and
regulations are relatively limited, without analogues in respect of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
protection for consumers, or prudential supervision of institutions. As a result, users may have
limited recourse as well as potentially heightened risks.
 Hackers are a threat. Despite the general inalterability of Blockchain transactions other aspects of
DeFi, including underlying software systems, may be susceptible and vulnerable to hacking risk,
which can result in theft or loss of funds.
 Private key requirements. With DeFi and cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency assets are stored in wallets,
which are often secured with private keys: long, unique codes known only to the owner of the wallet.
Loss of a private key may mean loss of access to funds.
As a result, some of the uncertainty regarding DeFi could create the potential for new, novel and unforeseen risks that
could materially affect the our business.
Recent Financial Distress of Certain Cryptoeconomy Participants May Reduce Customer Confidence in the
Cryptoeconomy, as well as the Financial Health of Aurox Users, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business
Aurox is aware of, and is closely monitoring, recent developments concerning the financial distress of a number of
Cryptoeconomy participants. Though Aurox’s business model, revenue structure and risk profile are, and will remain,
distinct from such institutions, in the event that the Aurox business model evolves and the Company develops lending
or margin-related products in the future, the Company will seek to diligently follow any associated regulations,
guidance and other developments. Furthermore, while Aurox is not an exchange and does not itself offer such
products or services, the Company collaborates with exchange providers with respect to certain Aurox Terminal
services. As a result, the Company is closely monitoring conditions impacting such exchange entities, and the
cryptoeconomy as a whole.
At the same time, continued distress and the potential for broader deterioration of conditions concerning
Cryptoeconomy participants may reduce the confidence and financial health of Aurox users and partners, upon which
Aurox is highly dependent, which could adversely impact our business.
Our new non-custodial digital asset wallet may not achieve our desired results and may expose us to new risks.
In October 2022, we launched a beta version of a non-custodial digital asset wallet, which allows users to manage,
send, receive and use cryptocurrencies and other digital assets across decentralized apps. We are also pursuing, and
plan to continue to pursue, other business and strategic initiatives associated with digital assets and Blockchain
technology.
The digital asset economy is highly competitive and rapidly evolving with frequent launches of new or improved
products and services, and frequent entry of new competitors in the U.S. and internationally. Engaging in these new
initiatives exposes us to a variety of risks, including our ability to successfully develop, obtain or introduce new and
improved, competitive, efficient and effective products, systems and processes, attract, maintain and grow our user
base, and hire and retain the necessary personnel to support these activities. If and to the extent we are unable to
successfully execute these initiatives, we may incur unanticipated costs and losses, and face other adverse
consequences, such as negative reputational effects. In addition, the actual effects of pursuing these initiatives may
differ, possibly materially, from the benefits that we expect to realize from them, such as the generation of revenues.
The launch of our beta versions of a non-custodial digital asset wallet also subjects us to risks similar to those
associated with any new product offerings, including, but not limited to, our ability to accurately anticipate market
15
demand and acceptance, creator and buyer acceptance, technical issues with the operation of the products, and legal
and regulatory risks as discussed herein.
Digital assets may be subject to hacking, social engineering and other cyber-attacks, which could subject us to
monetary losses, user disputes, reputational harm, and regulatory scrutiny.
Digital products and services are inherently digital and therefore subject to a heightened risk of hacking, cyber-attacks
and other cybersecurity threats. We have taken certain steps to mitigate against those risks. Despite these efforts, the
safeguards we have implemented or may implement in the future to protect against cybersecurity threats may be
insufficient to prevent malicious activities, and if our products and services are exploited and our digital assets are
stolen, we could experience significant financial harm.
Actual or perceived breaches or cybersecurity attacks directed to other digital asset platforms or services could also
create a general loss of user confidence in the digital asset industry and the use of Blockchain technologies, which
could negatively impact us.
In addition, our non-custodial digital asset wallet allows users to manage, send, receive and use cryptocurrencies
across decentralized apps. To own, transfer or use a digital asset on its underlying Blockchain network, a user must
have a private and public key pair associated with a network address, commonly referred to as a “wallet.” Each wallet
has a unique public key and private key pair, wherein each key is a string of alphanumerical characters. Digital assets
are generally controlled only by the possessor of the unique private key relating to the digital wallet in which the
digital assets are held, and such private key must be securely kept private to prevent a third party from accessing the
digital assets held in such a wallet.
We do not possess or have custody of private keys or wallet recovery phrases; the users of the wallet are solely
responsible for their private keys and wallet recovery phrases. If a private key to a wallet containing digital assets held
by a user is stolen, lost, destroyed or otherwise unavailable or compromised, and there is no available backup of the
private key, the user will be unable to access the digital assets in the related wallet. Any loss of private keys related
to, or a hack or other compromise of, the digital wallets used to manage users’ digital assets could adversely affect the
users’ ability to access, transfer or sell their digital assets, and subject us to user disputes, reputational harm, regulatory
scrutiny and other losses that could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
Cyberattacks and security breaches of our platform, or those impacting our users or third parties, could adversely
impact our brand and reputation as well as our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Although we operate a non-custodial platform, our business to some extent involves the collection, storage, processing,
and transmission of confidential information, customer, employee, service provider, and other personal data, as well
as information required to access customer assets. In essence, our software connects the users directly to the
Blockchain itself to effect given transactions. We have built our reputation on the premise that our platform offers
users a secure way to purchase, store, and transact in crypto assets. As a result, any actual or perceived security breach
of us or our third-party partners may:
 harm our reputation and brand;
 result in our systems or services being unavailable and interrupt our operations;
 result in improper disclosure of data and violations of applicable privacy and other laws;
 result in significant regulatory scrutiny, investigations, fines, penalties, and other legal, regulatory,
and financial exposure;
 cause us to incur significant remediation costs;
 lead to theft or irretrievable loss of our or our users’ fiat currencies or crypto assets;
16
 reduce customer confidence in, or decreased use of, our products and services;
 divert the attention of management from the operation of our business;
 result in significant compensation or contractual penalties from us to our users or third parties as a
result of losses to them or claims by them; and
 adversely affect our business and operating results.
Further, any actual or perceived breach or cybersecurity attack directed at other financial institutions or crypto
companies, whether or not we are directly impacted, could lead to a general loss of user confidence in the
cryptoeconomy or in the use of technology to conduct financial transactions, which could negatively impact us,
including the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and technology infrastructure.
An increasing number of organizations, including large merchants, businesses, technology companies, and financial
institutions, as well as government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their information security systems, some
of which have involved sophisticated and highly targeted attacks, including on their websites, mobile applications,
and infrastructure.
Attacks upon systems across a variety of industries, including the crypto industry, are increasing in their frequency,
persistence, and sophistication, and, in many cases, are being conducted by sophisticated, well-funded, and organized
groups and individuals, including state actors. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized, improper, or illegal access
to systems and information (including users’ personal data and crypto assets), disable or degrade services, or sabotage
systems are constantly evolving, may be difficult to detect quickly, and often are not recognized or detected until after
they have been launched against a target. These attacks may occur on our systems or those of our third-party service
providers or partners. Certain types of cyberattacks could harm us even if our systems are left undisturbed. For
example, attacks may be designed to deceive employees and service providers into releasing control of our systems to
a hacker, while others may aim to introduce computer viruses or malware into our systems with a view to stealing
confidential or proprietary data. Additionally, certain threats are designed to remain dormant or undetectable until
launched against a target and we may not be able to implement adequate preventative measures.
Although we have developed systems and processes designed to protect the data we manage, prevent data loss and
other security breaches, effectively respond to known and potential risks, and expect to continue to expend significant
resources to bolster these protections, there can be no assurance that these security measures will provide absolute
security or prevent breaches or attacks. In the future, we may experience breaches of our security measures due to
human error, malfeasance, insider threats, system errors or vulnerabilities, or other irregularities. We expect that
unauthorized parties will seek to gain access to our systems and facilities, as well as those of our users, partners, and
third-party service providers, through various means, including hacking, social engineering, phishing, and attempting
to fraudulently induce individuals (including employees, service providers, and our customers) into disclosing
usernames, payment card information, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our
information technology systems and users’ crypto assets. Threats can come from a variety of sources, including
criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage, and insiders. Certain threat actors may
be supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more sophisticated and difficult
to detect. Further, there has been an increase in such activities as a result of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19,
pandemic. As a result, our costs and the resources we devote to protecting against these advanced threats and their
consequences may continue to increase over time.
Although we will seek to procure insurance coverage that we believe is adequate for our business, it may be insufficient
to protect us against all losses and costs stemming from security breaches, cyberattacks, and other types of unlawful
activity, or any resulting disruptions from such events. Outages and disruptions of our platform, including any caused
by cyberattacks, may harm our reputation and our business, operating results, and financial condition.
Digital Assets and the broader Cryptoeconomy represent relatively nascent sectors, increasing risks to your
investment.
17
The cryptocurrency industry is subject to significant uncertainty and volatility, depending on a number of factors,
including, but not limited to, the following: the global economy, the financial markets and political conditions of
various countries; changes in the legislative or regulatory environment, including actions by governments or regulators,
including fines, orders or consent decrees; regulatory changes that can impact the company’s ability to offer certain
products or services; intense competition in the cryptocurrency exchange market that may adversely impact the
company’s business, results of operations, and financial condition; the company’s dependence on offerings that are
dependent on crypto asset trading activity, including trading volume and the prevailing trading prices for crypto assets,
whose trading prices and volume can be highly volatile; tax matters that may cause significant variability in the
company’s results of operations; and the company could be exposed to losses and/or reputational harm as a result of
various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of the company’s business. In addition, the demand for
cryptocurrency is influenced not only by overall economic conditions but also by changing trends in the
cryptoeconomy as to consumer preferences and perceived value of crypto assets and crypto asset markets. These
conditions and trends are difficult to predict and may adversely impact our ability to generate revenue in connection
with the purchase, sale, and trading of cryptocurrency, potentially causing significant variability in our results of
operations from time to time.
The further development and acceptance of the cryptocurrency industry is subject to a variety of factors that are
difficult to anticipate and evaluate. The use of cryptocurrency to buy and sell goods and services, among other things,
is a new and rapidly evolving industry. Although cryptocurrency may become a leading means of digital payment, it
cannot be assured that this will in fact occur. Any slowing or stopping of the development in the acceptance of
cryptocurrency may adversely affect an investment in the company. For a number of reasons, including, for example,
the lack of recognized security technologies, inefficient processing of payment transactions, problems in the handling
of warranty claims, limited user-friendliness, inconsistent quality, and lack of clear universally applicable regulation
as well as uncertainties regarding proprietary rights and other legal issues, cryptocurrency activities may in fact prove
in the long run to be an unprofitable means for businesses. Factors affecting the further development of the
cryptocurrency industry include: (i) continued worldwide growth in the adoption and use of cryptocurrency; (ii)
government and quasigovernment regulation of cryptocurrency and their use, or restrictions on or regulation of access
to and operation of cryptocurrency systems; (iii) changes in consumer demographics and public tastes and preferences;
(iv) the availability and popularity of other forms or methods of buying and selling goods and services; and (v) the
regulatory environment and general economic conditions and the regulatory environment related to cryptocurrency.
A decline in the popularity or acceptance of cryptocurrency would harm the business and affairs of the company.
If our systems, the Blockchain networks on which our digital asset products and services are offered, or our thirdparty partners fail to perform or are inadequate, we may experience adverse consequences, including financial
losses, user dissatisfaction and reputational harm.
Similar to other aspects of our business, our digital asset products and services are reliant on certain third-party partners,
including, but not limited to, fiat-to-crypto onramp providers, cloud computing services and data centers. Because we
rely on third parties to provide these services and to facilitate certain of our business activities, we face increased
operational risks. These third parties may be subject to legal, regulatory, financial, and labor issues, cybersecurity
incidents, computer viruses, break-ins, denial-of-service attacks, privacy breaches, sabotage, service terminations,
interruptions, disruptions, and other misconduct. They are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error,
fires, natural disasters (including, but not limited to, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes and tornados), power loss,
telecommunications failures, terrorism, vandalism, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and similar events.
Additionally, these third parties may breach their agreements with us or refuse to continue to renew their agreements
on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. There can be no assurances that third parties that provide products or
services to us or our users will continue to do so on acceptable terms, or at all. If any of these third parties do not
adequately or appropriately provide their services or perform their responsibilities to us or our users, or if such third
party partners decide to or are required by law to suspend or shut down products or services that we are relying on,
we may be unable to procure alternatives in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all, and we
may be subject to business disruptions, losses or costs to remediate any of the deficiencies, customer dissatisfaction,
reputational damage, legal or regulatory proceedings, or other adverse consequences which could harm our business.
In addition, we rely on one or more transaction protocols referred to as “smart contracts,” which include the
cryptographic operations that verify and secure transactions, in connection with our digital asset products or services.
A smart contract is software that digitally facilitates or enforces a rules-agreement or terms between transacting parties.
18
If the smart contracts fail to behave as expected, suffer cybersecurity attacks or security issues, become obsolete, or
encounter other issues, certain transactions may not be completed or erroneously executed, and we and our users may
experience significant harm, including irretrievable loss of digital assets.
A temporary or permanent blockchain “fork” to any supported crypto asset could adversely affect our business.
Blockchain protocols, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, are open source. Any user can download the software, modify
it, and then propose that Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain protocols users and miners adopt the modification.
When a modification is introduced and a substantial majority of users and miners consent to the modification, the
change is implemented and the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain protocol networks, as applicable, remain
uninterrupted. However, if less than a substantial majority of users and miners consent to the proposed modification,
and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is
known as a “fork” (i.e., “split”) of the impacted blockchain protocol network and respective blockchain, with one
prong running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would
be the existence of two parallel versions of the Bitcoin, Ethereum or other blockchain protocol network, as applicable,
running simultaneously, but with each split network’s crypto asset lacking interchangeability.
Both Bitcoin and Ethereum protocols have been subject to “forks” that resulted in the creation of new networks,
including Bitcoin Cash ABC, Bitcoin Cash SV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold, Ethereum Classic, and others. Some
of these forks have caused fragmentation as to the correct naming convention for forked crypto assets. Due to the lack
of a central registry or rulemaking body, no single entity has the ability to dictate the nomenclature of forked crypto
assets, causing disagreements and a lack of uniformity among platforms on the nomenclature of forked crypto assets,
and which results in further confusion to customers as to the nature of assets they hold on platforms. In addition,
several of these forks were contentious and as a result, participants in certain communities may harbor ill will towards
other communities. As a result, certain community members may take actions that adversely impact the use, adoption,
and price of Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any of their forked alternatives.
Furthermore, hard forks can lead to new security concerns. For instance, when the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic
networks split in July 2016, replay attacks, in which transactions from one network were rebroadcast on the other
network to achieve “double-spending”, plagued platforms that traded Ethereum through at least October 2016,
resulting in significant losses to some crypto asset platforms. Similar replay attacks occurred in connection with the
Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Cash SV network split in November 2018. Another possible result of a hard fork is an
inherent decrease in the level of security due to the splitting of some mining power across networks, making it easier
for a malicious actor to exceed 50% of the mining power of that network, thereby making crypto assets that rely on
proof-of-work more susceptible to attack, as has occurred with Ethereum Classic.
We do not believe that we are required to support any fork or provide the benefit of any forked crypto asset to our
customers. However, we may in the future continue to be subject to claims by customers arguing that they are entitled
to receive certain forked or airdropped crypto assets by virtue of crypto assets that they hold. If any customers succeed
on a claim that they are entitled to receive the benefits of a forked or airdropped crypto asset that we do not or are
unable to support, we may be required to pay significant damages, fines or other fees to compensate customers for
their losses.
Future forks may occur at any time. A fork can lead to a disruption of networks and our information technology
systems, cybersecurity attacks, replay attacks, or security weaknesses, any of which can further lead to temporary or
even permanent loss of our and our customers’ assets. Such disruption and loss could cause us to be exposed to liability,
even in circumstances where we have no intention of supporting an asset compromised by a fork.
We currently support, and expect to continue to support, certain smart contract-based crypto assets. If the
underlying smart contracts for these crypto assets do not operate as expected, they could lose value and our business
could be adversely affected.
We currently support, and expect to continue to support, various crypto assets that represent units of value on smart
contracts deployed on a third party blockchain. Smart contracts are programs that store and transfer value and execute
automatically when certain conditions are met. Since smart contracts typically cannot be stopped or reversed,
vulnerabilities in their programming and design can have damaging effects. For instance, in April 2018, a batch
19
overflow bug was found in many Ethereum-based ERC20-compatible smart contract tokens that allows hackers to
create a large number of smart contract tokens, causing multiple crypto asset platforms worldwide to shut down
ERC20-compatible token trading. Similarly, in March 2020, a design flaw in the MakerDAO smart contract caused
forced liquidations of crypto assets at significantly discounted prices, resulting in millions of dollars of losses to users
who had deposited crypto assets into the smart contract. If any such vulnerabilities or flaws come to fruition, smart
contract-based crypto assets, including those held by our customers on our platforms, may suffer negative publicity,
be exposed to security vulnerabilities, decline significantly in value, and lose liquidity over a short period of time.
In some cases, smart contracts can be controlled by one or more “admin keys” or users with special privileges, or
“super users”. These users have the ability to unilaterally make changes to the smart contract, enable or disable features
on the smart contract, change how the smart contract receives external inputs and data, and make other changes to the
smart contract. For smart contracts that hold a pool of reserves, these users may also be able to extract funds from the
pool, liquidate assets held in the pool, or take other actions that decrease the value of the assets held by the smart
contract in reserves. Even for crypto assets that have adopted a decentralized governance mechanism, such as smart
contracts that are governed by the holders of a governance token, such governance tokens can be concentrated in the
hands of a small group of core community members, who would be able to make similar changes unilaterally to the
smart contract. If any such super user or group of core members unilaterally make adverse changes to a smart contract,
the design, functionality, features and value of the smart contract, its related crypto assets may be harmed. In addition,
assets held by the smart contract in reserves may be stolen, misused, burnt, locked up or otherwise become unusable
and irrecoverable. These super users can also become targets of hackers and malicious attackers. If an attacker is able
to access or obtain the super user privileges of a smart contract, or if a smart contract’s super-users or core community
members take actions that adversely affects the smart contract, customers who hold and transact in the affected crypto
assets may experience decreased functionality and value of the applicable crypto assets, up to and including a total
loss of the value of such crypto assets. Although we do not control these smart contracts or crypto assets, any such
events could cause customers to seek damages against us for their losses, result in reputational damage to us, or in
other ways adversely impact our business.
From time to time, we may encounter technical issues in connection with the integration of supported crypto assets
and changes and upgrades to their underlying networks, which could adversely affect our business. In order to support
any supported crypto asset, a variety of front and back-end technical and development work is required to implement
our wallet, trading, staking and other solutions for our customers, and to integrate such supported crypto asset with
our existing technical infrastructure. For certain crypto assets, a significant amount of development work is required
and there is no guarantee that we will be able to integrate successfully with any existing or future crypto asset. In
addition, such integration may introduce software errors or weaknesses into our platform, including our existing
infrastructure. Even if such integration is initially successful, any number of technical changes, software upgrades,
soft or hard forks, cybersecurity incidents, or other changes to the underlying blockchain network may occur from
time to time, causing incompatibility, technical issues, disruptions, or security weaknesses to our platform. If we are
unable to identify, troubleshoot and resolve any such issues successfully, we may no longer be able to support such
crypto asset, our customers’ assets may be frozen or lost, the security of our hot, warm, or cold wallets may be
compromised, and our platform and technical infrastructure may be affected, all of which could adversely impact our
business.
There are Legal and Regulatory Risks of Businesses Based on Cryptocurrencies and Crypto Assets.
The regulation of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets continues to evolve in every jurisdiction, and governmental,
regulatory and other changes or actions may restrict the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, the operation of
distributed ledger technologies that support such cryptocurrencies and platforms that facilitate the trading of such
assets and provide certain services in connection with such assets.
As cryptocurrencies and crypto assets have grown in popularity and in market size, governments, regulators and selfregulators (including law enforcement and national security agencies) around the world are examining the operations
of crypto asset issuers, customers and platforms. To the extent that any Canadian, U.S. or other government or
quasigovernmental agency imposes additional substantial regulation on any part of the cryptocurrency industry in
general, the issuance of crypto assets, and trading and ownership of and transactions involving the purchase and sale
or pledge of such assets, may be adversely affected, which could adversely affect the Company’s businesses and
investments. The effect of any future regulatory change on crypto asset issuers and participants in general is impossible
20
to predict, but such change could materially and adversely affect the Company’s trading execution, the value of its
assets and the value of any investment in the Company.
The legal status of cryptocurrency and crypto assets varies substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is still
undefined and changing in many of them.
As a U.S. company, Aurox is subject to regulation by U.S. regulatory authorities at the corporate level. At the same
time, Aurox employs certain individuals not domiciled in the United States and also has customers that are not U.S.
citizens. Because of this, it is possible that Aurox may in the future need to register or be subject to the laws of other
jurisdictions even in the event that Aurox does not intend to expand its business into such jurisdictions.
If Aurox is deemed to be doing business in such foreign jurisdiction by a foreign regulator, the Company will be
potentially exposed to a greater variety of legal and regulatory considerations. Furthermore, the potential for differing
regulatory treatment in different jurisdictions may present a complicating factor that ultimately hinders or deters
potential expansion by the Company into additional jurisdictions.
The company’s performance will be highly dependent on the future regulatory environment in the United States
and elsewhere, which is challenging and unpredictable.
The company is headquartered in the United States. Therefore, although the company intends to extend its operations
and customer bases in other countries, it is likely that the ability to conduct business in the United States and with U.S.
customers will remain critical to the company’s results and prospects. For businesses that involve cryptocurrencies or
other crypto assets, the regulatory environment in the United States has been mixed. Notwithstanding that U.S.
legislators and regulators generally express support for innovation in financial markets and products, they have
arguably not moved quickly to clarify the status of cryptocurrencies and other crypto assets (and associated financial
services) under U.S. laws, especially securities, commodities, banking and money-transmitter laws, or to
accommodate proposals for new businesses or offerings.
In recent years, the SEC has taken noteworthy actions to, among other things, sanction many issuers of digital tokens,
reject applications for crypto-related exchange-traded funds and suggest that bitcoin and other crypto assets are not
suitable holdings for traditional investment funds. It is impossible to predict what directions U.S. regulation might
take in the future, which depend among other things like agency priorities and budgets, agency personnel turnover
and appointments following presidential elections, legislation, judicial decisions, public perception, and economic
conditions. There can be no assurance that U.S. regulation will advance in a way that is favorable for the company.
Regulatory, Legal and Litigation Risks
The U.S. Regulatory Environment for Digital Assets is Highly Uncertain and Outside of Our Control.
Regulation of Blockchain technology and digital assets is being contemplated by the United States at the federal level
through a number of regulatory agencies, as well as in respect of certain individual states. Globally, many jurisdictions
are actively pursuing regulation that meets the specific needs of the digital asset and crypto currency markets, ensuring
that investors and other stakeholders are well-protected.
New or revised regulations or policies affecting digital assets and Blockchain technology, or new interpretations of
existing laws and regulations by governmental and regulatory bodies in respect of digital assets and Blockchain
technology could have substantial and adverse effects on our digital asset investments, products or services. As such,
in the future we could be subject to inquiries or investigations from regulators and governmental authorities, be
required to divest our digital asset holdings, make product changes, restrict or discontinue product offerings, including
our users’ acquisition, use or redemption of certain digital assets, and be required to implement additional and
potentially costly controls. In addition, if we expand our digital asset business to include new products and services,
we could come under the geographical jurisdiction of additional regulators, both with respect to jurisdiction and
subject matter. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any
governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or orders),
including those discussed in these risk factors, may (i) subject us to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil
21
lawsuits, enforcement proceedings, and forfeiture of significant assets, (ii) result in additional compliance and
licensure requirements, increased regulatory scrutiny of our business and restrictions of our operations, and (iii) force
us to modify our business practices, make product or operational changes, and/or delay planned product launches or
improvements. We currently maintain policies and procedures designed to reasonably help ensure compliance with
applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not
violate such laws and regulations.
There are Legal and Regulatory Risks of Businesses Based on Cryptocurrencies and Crypto Assets.
The regulation of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets continues to evolve in every jurisdiction, and governmental,
regulatory and other changes or actions may restrict the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets, the operation of
distributed ledger technologies that support such cryptocurrencies and platforms that facilitate the trading of such
assets and provide certain services in connection with such assets. As cryptocurrencies and crypto assets have grown
in popularity and in market size, governments, regulators and self-regulators (including law enforcement and national
security agencies) around the world are examining the operations of crypto asset issuers, customers and platforms. To
the extent that any U.S. or other government or quasigovernmental agency imposes additional substantial regulation
on any part of the cryptocurrency industry in general, the issuance of crypto assets, and trading and ownership of and
transactions involving the purchase and sale or pledge of such assets, may be adversely affected, which could adversely
affect the company’s business. The effect of any future regulatory change on crypto asset issuers and participants in
general is impossible to predict, but such change could materially and adversely affect the company’s trading
execution, the value of its assets and the value of any investment in the company.
The legal status of cryptocurrency and crypto assets varies substantially from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is still
undefined and changing in many of them. Likewise, various government agencies, departments, and courts have
classified and continue to classify cryptocurrencies and crypto assets differently. Changes in laws, regulations, policies
and practices could have an adverse effect on the company, its strategies, business and investments. For example,
regulatory agencies could shut down or restrict the use of Crypto Trading Platforms using cryptocurrencies, crypto
assets or Blockchain-based technologies, providing certain services with respect to the foregoing, or otherwise limit
the use of cryptocurrencies. This, and any other changes in laws, regulations, policies and practices, may trigger
regulatory action by securities or other regulators, and result in a material impact to the company’s business operations.
Furthermore, various jurisdictions may, in the near future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect
cryptocurrencies, the related markets and Crypto Trading Platforms and the ability to use, trade and hold
cryptocurrencies.
Although there continues to be uncertainty about the full impact of these and other regulatory changes, the company
may become subject to a more complex regulatory framework in the near future and incur additional costs to comply
with new requirements as well as to monitor for compliance with any new requirements in the future.
The company’s performance will be highly dependent on the future regulatory environment in the United States
and elsewhere, which is challenging and unpredictable.
The company is headquartered in the United States. Therefore, although the company intends to extend its operations
and user bases to other countries, it is likely that the ability to conduct business in the United States and with U.S.
users and customers will remain critical to the company’s results and prospects. For businesses that involve
cryptocurrencies or other crypto assets, the regulatory environment in the United States has been mixed. In recent
years, the SEC has taken noteworthy actions to, among other things, sanction many issuers of digital tokens, reject
applications for crypto-related exchange-traded funds and suggest that bitcoin and other crypto assets are not suitable
holdings for traditional investment funds. There can be no assurance that U.S. regulation will advance in a way that is
favorable for the company.
Furthermore, in comparison to traditional securities or commodities markets, U.S. law and regulation remains thinly
developed with respect to financial services provided to the cryptocurrency and crypto asset markets. To the extent
the company offers certain crypto asset financial services, emerging regulation or enforcement activity may have a
material impact on the company’s ability to continue providing such service thereby affecting the company’s revenues
and profitability as well as its reputation and resources.
22
Future developments regarding the treatment of digital assets under U.S. and foreign tax laws could adversely
impact our business.
Current tax rules related to digital assets are in some instances unclear and require significant judgments to be made
in interpretation of the law, including but not limited to the areas of income tax, information reporting, transaction
level taxes and the withholding of tax at source. Additional legislation or guidance may be issued by U.S. and nonU.S. governing bodies that may differ significantly from our practices or interpretation of the law, which could have
unforeseen effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
The company may be required to register as an “investment company” under U.S. law or comparable laws in other
jurisdictions.
The company has considered whether it is required to register, in any capacity, under the relevant securities,
commodity futures or derivatives legislation of the United States, and specifically whether the company is an
“investment company” under the laws of the United States.
Registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 turns, as an initial matter, on
whether or not the company supports, custodies, intermediates, or facilitates, in any fashion, transactions involving
“securities,” as defined in section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933. The company believes that it has taken
reasonable measures to ensure that it does not support, custody, intermediate, or facilitate transactions or activities
with respect to products that constitutes “securities.”
Due to the fact that the company reasonably believes that it does not support or facilitate securities on its platform, the
company does not believe that it is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act
of 1940. The company’s conclusion that it is not required to be so registered under U.S. securities laws is based on
the due diligence and risk-based analysis performed by third-parties on digital assets supported, or proposed for
inclusion, on its platform. The company relies on such third-party analyses because the Company is not itself an
exchange, but rather a data platform that routes transactions to third party exchanges for digital assets which are
required to perform ongoing due diligence and risk-based analysis to ensure that supported digital assets do not
constitute securities under U.S. securities laws.
In the event that the Company’s conclusions prove incorrect, or the relevant law or regulatory guidance subsequently
changes, and the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940, such registration requirement may materially affect the Company’s business and its operations.
The company may be required to register as a broker-dealer under U.S. law or comparable laws in other
jurisdictions.
The company has considered whether it is required to register, in any capacity, under the relevant securities,
commodity futures or derivatives legislation of the United States, and specifically whether the company is a “brokerdealer” under the laws of the United States.
Registration as a broker or dealer under Section 3(a)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act turns, as an initial matter, on whether
or not the company supports, custodies, intermediates, or facilitates, in any fashion, transactions involving “securities,”
as defined in section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933. The company believes that it has taken reasonable measures
to ensure that it does not support, custody, intermediate, or facilitate transactions or activities with respect to products
that constitutes “securities,” however as discussed above largely relies on third-parties for this analysis and
determination.
Due to the fact that the company reasonably believes that it does not support or facilitate securities on its platform, the
company does not believe that it is required to register as a broker-dealer or exchange with the SEC as indicated above.
The company’s conclusion that it is not required to be so registered under U.S. securities laws is based on the due
diligence and risk-based analysis performed by third-parties on digital assets supported, or proposed for inclusion, on
its platform. The company relies on such third-party analyses because the Company is not itself an exchange, but
rather a data platform that routes transactions to third party exchanges for digital assets which are required to perform
23
ongoing due diligence and risk-based analysis to ensure that supported digital assets do not constitute securities under
U.S. securities laws.
In the event that the Company’s conclusions prove incorrect, or the relevant law or regulatory guidance subsequently
changes, and the Company is required to register as a broker-dealer, such registration requirement may materially
affect the Company’s business and its operations.
Potential Registration under the Commodities Exchange Act or Other Legislation Would Materially Impair Our
Business.
The company’s platform currently only facilitates ‘spot’ transactions in digital assets. The company does not provide
any digital asset transactions on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis; however, the company does allow users to
link accounts to platforms such as Binance where such digital asset transactions may be conducted. Spot transactions
are not considered Retail Commodity Transactions, and therefore the company is not subject to the registration and
CFTC oversight considerations outlined above.
The company’s conclusion that it is not subject to the aforementioned additional CFTC oversight and registration
provisions is based upon (a) the plain language of the CEA and (b) ongoing review and analysis of relevant CFTC
guidance.
Changes to U.S. Regulatory Frameworks Would Adversely Affect Our Business and Operations and are Entirely
Outside our Control.
The company recognizes that the legal regime surrounding digital assets in the U.S. is evolving. Digital assets are a
relatively new asset class. Rather, the SEC has communicated to industry participants that it will apply existing
securities laws, including the four-part Howey Test developed by the U.S. Supreme Court for determining whether an
“investment contract” constitutes a security, to digital assets.
In addition, it is possible that the SEC, CFTC, or other state or federal regulator could publish additional regulatory
guidance that alters the company’s regulatory obligations, or that the U.S. implements a comprehensive regulatory
regime in respect of digital asset businesses. Such developments could materially alter the company’s registration
requirements, require it to remove certain digital assets from its platform or require it to cease certain aspects of its
operations.
Potential Registration Requirements under FinCEN or as a state-level money services business would materially
impair our business
Because the company does not facilitate transactions in fiat currency, or itself operate an exchange, the Company does
not believe that it is subject to registration requirements under FinCEN or as a state money services business. If the
company’s conclusion proved incorrect, or the relevant regulatory requirements at the state or federal level change, it
could materially and negatively impact the Company’s business.
Potential Changes to FASB Accounting Policies and Methodologies could materially impair out business
Certain changes to the valuation and reporting requirements for on-balance sheet digital assets have been proposed
and are being contemplated by the FASB. Because the company holds limited amounts of digital assets for its own
account, the Company does not believe that such changes would materially affect the Company’s business. However,
if the nature of the Company’s business changes, or if the contemplated FASB changes are distinct from the
Company’s understanding of what is being contemplated, it could materially impair the Company’s business and
financial position from a reporting perspective.
There are material risks and uncertainties associated with the company’s anti-money-laundering (“AML”), “know
your customer” (“KYC”) and other protocols to detect and deter illegal activity on the company’s platforms,
including the Company’s heavy reliance on our partners and third-parties for implementation of such programs
24
The company seeks to implement and maintain anti-money-laundering, “know your customer” and other policies and
procedures that are consistent with applicable U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations and with financial services
industry best practices. Nonetheless, the company may not be able to prevent illegal activity from occurring on or
through its platforms, including the unauthorized use of a validly opened account. The use of cryptocurrencies or other
crypto assets for illegal purposes on or through the company’s platform, or allegations or investigations with respect
to potential such use, could result in significant legal and financial exposure to the company and damage to the
company’s reputation. Similarly, failure to meet applicable AML/KYC legal and regulatory requirements could result
in regulatory fines, sanctions or restrictions, which in each case could materially and adversely affect the company’s
reputation, financial condition, trading execution, and asset value and the value of any investment in the company.
Furthermore, the company uses and relies upon third-party service providers to complete key aspects of AML/KYC
screenings. Although the company performs due diligence on such providers themselves, the company does not
perform AML/KYC transaction monitoring with respect to the individual end-users. Thus, there can be no assurance
that in all events such providers will detect all potential illegal activity or comply with all aspects of applicable law
and regulation. If such a third-party provider were to fail to perform to agreed standards or maintain full compliance,
it could have a material and adverse effect on the company’s business and operations.
The Company relies on our partners and third-parties to conduct adequate diligence to ensure that certain digital
assets are not subject to U.S. securities laws.
The Company does not itself perform analyses as to whether certain digital assets listed on its platform constitute
securities under U.S. securities laws. Instead, similar to the company’s approach with respect to KYC/AML
compliance, the Company relies on its partners and third-parties to sufficiently perform these analyses. If such a thirdparty provider were to fail to perform to agreed standards or maintain full compliance, it could have a material and
adverse effect on the company’s business and operations.
The company’s compliance and risk management programs may not be effective and may result in outcomes that
could materially and adversely affect the company’s reputation, financial condition and operating results, among
other things.
The company’s ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and
maintenance of compliance, review and reporting systems, as well as the ability to attract and retain qualified
compliance and other risk management personnel. The company cannot provide any assurance that its compliance
policies and procedures will always be effective or that the company will always be successful in monitoring or
evaluating its risks. In the case of alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, the company could be
subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in substantial penalties or civil
lawsuits, including by customers, for damages, restitution or other remedies, which could be significant. Any of these
outcomes, individually or together, may among other things, materially and adversely affect the company’s reputation,
financial condition, trading execution, and asset value and the value of any investment in the company.
Additional Risks Related to Our Business, Intellectual Property and Operations
We rely on trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property protections, which may not be adequate to protect
us from misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property.
We rely on a combination of trade secret and other intellectual property protections in the U.S. We rely on unregistered
proprietary rights, including common law trademark protection. Third parties may use trademarks identical or
confusingly similar to ours, or independently develop trade secrets or know-how similar or equivalent to ours. If our
proprietary information is divulged to third parties, including our competitors, or our intellectual property rights are
otherwise misappropriated or infringed, our business could be harmed or adversely affected.
We could incur substantial costs as a result of any claim of infringement of another party’s intellectual property
rights.
25
The company may be subject to claims that it violated intellectual property rights of others, which are extremely costly
to defend and could require the company to pay significant damages and limit its ability to operate. Companies in the
cryptocurrency industry, and other patent, copyright and trademark holders, own large numbers of patents, copyrights,
trademarks and trade secrets and may enter into litigation based on claims of infringement or other violations of
intellectual property rights. The company might receive in the future notices that claim it is using or has
misappropriated or misused other parties’ intellectual property rights. There may be intellectual property rights held
by others, including issued or pending patents, copyrights and trademarks that cover significant aspects of the
company’s content, technology, branding or business methods. Any intellectual property claim against the company
could be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert management’s attention and other
resources. These claims also could subject the company to significant liability for damages and could result in the
company’s having to rescind its contracts whereby the company provides its technological content or business
methods if found to be in violation of another party’s rights. The company might be required or may opt to seek a
license for rights to intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms
or at all. Even if a license is available, the company could be required to pay significant royalties (in excess of the
anticipated fees payable to contractors or the Founders), which would increase its operating expenses. The company
may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing content, branding or business methods, which could require
significant effort and expense and make the company less competitive. If the company cannot license or develop
content, branding or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, the company may be unable
to effectively compete. Any of these results could harm our operating results.
Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could substantially harm our business and operating results.
Because our business depends substantially on our intellectual property, the protection of our intellectual property
rights is important to the success of our business. We will rely upon a combination of trademark, patent, trade secret
and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. These afford only limited protection.
Despite our future efforts to protect our property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our
products, service, software and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. Moreover,
policing our proprietary rights is difficult and may not always be effective. In addition, we may need to enforce our
rights under the laws of countries that do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United
States.
Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and
administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual
property rights, to protect our patent rights, trade secrets, trademarks and domain names, and to determine the validity
and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation or proceedings may be very costly and impact our financial
performance. We may also incur substantial costs defending against frivolous litigation or be asked to indemnify our
customers against the same. Our efforts to enforce or protect our proprietary rights may prove to be ineffective and
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could substantially harm our operating results.
Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions, as we
have less opportunity to have visibility into the development process with respect to acquired technology or the care
taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Third-parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after
we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.
We might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available.
We have funded our operations since inception through equity financings. We cannot be certain when or if our
operations will generate sufficient cash to fully fund our ongoing operations or the growth of our business. We intend
to continue to make investments in our business to respond to business challenges, including developing new products
and services, enhancing our operating infrastructure, expanding our operations, and acquiring complementary
businesses and technologies, any or all of which may require us to secure additional funds. Additional financing may
not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights senior
to holders of our common stock to make claims on our assets, and the terms of any debt could restrict our operations,
including our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. We may issue shares of capital stock, including in the
form of Series X Preferred Stock, to our customers in connection with customer reward or loyalty programs. If we
issue additional equity securities, stockholders will experience dilution, and the new equity securities could have rights
26
senior to those of our currently authorized and issued common stock. As the crypto asset markets remain volatile, the
trading prices for our common stock may be highly volatile, which may reduce our ability to access capital on
favorable terms or at all. In addition, a slowdown or other sustained adverse downturn in the general economic or
crypto asset markets could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock. Because our decision to
raise capital in the future will depend on numerous considerations, including factors beyond our control, we cannot
predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of securities. As a result, our stockholders
bear the risk of future issuances of debt or equity securities reducing the value of our common stock and diluting their
interests. Our inability to obtain adequate debt financing or equity financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we
require it, could significantly limit our ability to continue supporting our business growth and responding to business
challenges.
Operational risks, such as misconduct and errors of employees or entities with which the company does business,
are difficult to detect and deter and could cause material reputational and financial harm to the company.
The company’s employees and agents could engage in misconduct, which may include conducting and concealing
unauthorized activities or improper use or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. It is not always possible
to deter misconduct by employees or others, and the precautions that the company takes to prevent and detect this
activity may not be effective in all cases. The company could be at risk, for example, that its employees could engage
in prohibited personal trading of a cryptocurrency or crypto asset supported by one of the company’s platforms, which
could lead to actions such as trading suspensions, fines and costs or other regulatory actions, which, in each case,
could have a material and adverse effect on the company. Furthermore, the company’s employees could make errors
in recording or executing transactions for clients, customers or counterparties, which would likely result in additional
and potentially material costs to the company.
We are dependent on certain key personnel, the loss of which may adversely affect our financial condition or results
of operations.
Major capital allocation decisions and investment decisions are made by the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman
of the Board of Directors, Giorgi Khazaradze, with consultation from key personnel, from our management team. We
do not currently have key man insurance on Mr. Khazaradze. If Mr. Khazaradze were to become unavailable, there
could be a material adverse impact on our operations. However, the company’s Board of Directors have the power
and authority to fill a vacancy left by Mr. Khazaradze. The ability to retain key personnel is important to our success
and future growth. Competition for these professionals can be intense, and we may not be able to retain and motivate
our existing officers and senior employees, and continue to compensate such individuals competitively. The
unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on our operations
and negatively impact our financial condition or results of operations of our businesses, and could hinder the ability
of our business and our subsidiaries to effectively compete in the various industries in which we operate.
We May Have Uninsured or Uninsurable Risks.
The company intends to insure its operations in accordance with technology industry practice. However, given the
novelty of the proposed business, such insurance may not be available, uneconomical for the company, or the nature
or level may be insufficient to provide adequate insurance cover. The company may become subject to liability for
hazards against which it cannot insure or against which it may elect not to insure because of high premium costs or
for other reasons. The payment of any such liabilities would reduce or eliminate the funds available for operations.
Payments of liabilities for which the company does not carry insurance may have a material adverse effect on its
financial position.
Risks Related to our Organizational Structure and Governance
We are an “emerging growth company” under the JOBS Act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure
requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions
from various reporting requirements that are not applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth
27
companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our
periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote
on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We
cannot predict if investors will find our Common Stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If
some investors find our Common Stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our
Common Stock and our stock price may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the
extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) for
complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the
adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are
choosing to take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of
the date of the first sale of our Common Stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our Common Stock that is held by non-affiliates
exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.
The company’s Founders control a significant percentage of our Common Stock, and may exert significant control
over matters subject to stockholder approval as well as heightened voting power at the board level, preventing other
stockholders and new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.
Pursuant to a shareholder agreement, (the “Shareholder Agreement”), the Founders will vote all shares of Voting
Stock owned by them to elect each of the Founders to the Board along with other designees mutually agreed upon. By
virtue of the Shareholder Agreement and ownership of the Company’s Series X Preferred Stock, on a post-Offering
basis and assuming that all 169,000 shares are sold in this offering, the Founders will represent 97.56% of the
Shareholder Stock with respect to matters that may have a material impact on company strategy and shareholder rights.
As a result of the Founder’s level of ownership of company Shares as defined in the Shareholder Agreement, the
Founders have a substantially higher number of votes relative to other investors.
The concentration of our Common Stock ownership by our current founders and executives will limit your ability
to influence corporate matters.
Our founders and executive officers beneficially are able to vote to the extent of approximately 97.56% of our
outstanding Common Stock prior to this offering and will own approximately 78.93% of our outstanding Common
Stock after this offering(with the power to vote to the extent of approximately 97.40%) . As such, our directors and
executive officers, as stockholders, will have the ability to exert significant influence over all corporate activities,
including the election or removal of directors and the outcome of tender offers, mergers, proxy contests or other
purchases of Common Stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the thenprevailing market price for their shares of Common Stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence
corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. In addition,
such concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control. In such cases, the perception of
our prospects in the market may be adversely affected and the market price of our Common Stock may decline.
Existing and Potential Conflicts of Interest May Harm Your Investment
The company and its affiliates are subject, and each of them and the company are exposed, to a number of actual and
potential conflicts of interest. For example, the company licenses certain technologies from Aurox LLC, an entity that
is owned and controlled by our Founders. Additionally, the company has entered into a license agreement with an
entity controlled by Mr. Naglic, one of our Founders, for use of the Aurox Token. Any such conflict of interest could
have a material adverse effect on the company and the shareholders’ investments therein.
28
The company does not currently own its intellectual property; Founders have entered into a license agreement with
the company assigning their intellectual property to the company.
The company does not currently own its intellectual property and is licensing such intellectual property, which has
been developed by the Founders, from the Founders’ entity. The Founders shall receive certain fees and royalties
pursuant to the licensing agreement. Additionally, the company has entered into a license agreement with an entity
controlled by Mr. Naglic, one of our Founders, for use of the Aurox Token. In the event that one or both of licensing
agreements for the intellectual property or the Aurox Token is terminated, the company may no longer have access to
the intellectual property, or the Aurox Token and its business and operations will suffer significantly.
Our Founders each own super voting Preferred Stock.
Our Founders each own one (1) share of the company’s Series X Preferred Stock entitling each of them to vote to the
extent of ten times (10x) of the Common Stock that they each own at any general or special meeting of shareholder.
As a result, other shareholders in the company will not have any impact on any vote submitted to the shareholders. As
such, our Founders will have the ability to exert significant influence over all corporate activities, including the
election or removal of directors and the outcome of tender offers, mergers, proxy contests or other purchases of our
Common Stock that could give our stockholders the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market
price for their shares of our Common Stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate
matters and, as a result, we may take actions that our stockholders do not view as beneficial. In addition, such
concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control. In such cases, the perception of our
prospects in the market may be adversely affected and the market price of our Common Stock may decline.
Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for the indemnification of officers and directors at our expense and
limits their liability, which may result in a major cost to us and hurt the interests of our stockholders because
corporate resources may be expended for the benefit of officers or directors.
As permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and Bylaws limit or
eliminate the personal liability of our directors. Consequently, a director will not be personally liable to us or our
stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability for:
 any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;
 any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of law;
 any unlawful payments related to dividends or unlawful stock repurchases, redemptions or other
distributions; or
 any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.
These limitations of liability do not alter director liability under the federal securities laws and do not affect the
availability of equitable remedies such as an injunction or rescission.
In addition, our Bylaws provide for:
 indemnify our directors, officers and, at the discretion of our board of directors, certain employees
to the fullest extent permitted by the Nevada Revised Statutes; and
 advance expenses, including attorneys’ fees, to our directors and, at the discretion of our board of
directors, to our officers and certain employees, in connection with legal proceedings, subject to
limited exceptions.
We also may enter into indemnification agreements with each of our executive officers and directors. These
agreements would provide that we will indemnify each of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Nevada
29
Revised Statutes and advance expenses to each indemnitee in connection with any proceeding in which
indemnification is available.
We may also maintain management liability insurance to provide insurance coverage to our directors and officers for
losses arising out of claims based on acts or omissions in their capacities as directors or officers, including liabilities
under the Securities Act. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to
directors, officers, or persons controlling the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, in the opinion of the SEC
such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is therefore unenforceable.
These provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors in the future for any
breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions may also have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative
litigation against directors and officers, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our
stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of
settlement and damage awards against directors, officers and certain employees pursuant to these indemnification
provisions. We believe that these provisions, the indemnification agreements and the insurance are necessary to attract
and retain talented and experienced directors and officers.
At present, we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that might result in a claim for such
indemnification.
General Risk Factors
The company may fail to anticipate or adapt to technology innovations in a timely manner, or at all.
The Blockchain and telecommunications markets are experiencing rapid technological changes. Failure to anticipate
technological innovations or adapt to such innovations in a timely manner, or at all, may result in the company’s
products becoming obsolete at sudden and unpredictable intervals. To maintain the relevancy of the company’s
products, the company has actively invested in product planning and research and development. The process of
developing and marketing new products is inherently complex and involves significant uncertainties. There are a
number of risks, including the following:
 the company’s product planning efforts may fail in resulting in the development or
commercialization of new technologies or ideas;
 the company’s research and development efforts may fail to translate new product plans into
commercially feasible products;
 the company’s new technologies or new products may not be well received by consumers;
 the company may not have adequate funding and resources necessary for continual investments in
product planning and research and development;
 the company’s products may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes
in consumer preferences; and
 the company’s newly developed technologies may not be protected as proprietary intellectual
property rights.
Any failure to anticipate the next-generation technology roadmap or changes in customer preferences or to timely
develop new or enhanced products in response could result in decreased revenue and market share. In particular, the
company may experience difficulties with product design, product development, marketing or certification, which
could result in excessive research and development expenses and capital expenditure, delays or prevent the company’s
introduction of new or enhanced products. Furthermore, the company’s research and development efforts may not
yield the expected results or may prove to be futile due to the lack of market demand.
30
Our ability to grow and compete in the future will be adversely affected if adequate capital is not available.
The ability of our business to grow and compete depends on the availability of adequate capital, which in turn depends
in large part on our cash flow from operations and the availability of equity and debt financing. Our cash flow from
operations may not be sufficient or we may not be able to obtain equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all
to implement our growth strategy. As a result, adequate capital may not be available to finance our current growth
plans, take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could harm our
business.
Our failure to successfully execute our business plan, maintain and expand our operations, and invest in our
business could require us to seek additional capital.
We may require additional capital in the future if we fail to successfully execute our business plan, and we may not
be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we raise additional equity financing,
our stockholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interests, and the per-share value of our
outstanding stock could decline. Moreover, any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and
privileges senior to those of holders of our outstanding stock. If we engage in debt financing, we may be required to
accept terms that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and force us to maintain specified liquidity or
other ratios. If we need additional capital and cannot raise or otherwise obtain it on acceptable terms, we may not be
able to, among other things:
 Maintain or increase our product/service offerings;
 Develop or introduce product enhancements;
 Continue to expand our development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative
organizations;
 Acquire complementary technologies or businesses;
 Expand our operations in the United States or internationally;
 Hire and retain management, administrative staff, the coaches who implement our educational
programs or other employees; or
 Respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated working capital requirements.
Competition in our industry could intensify, which could adversely affect our revenue, profitability and market
share.
The market for our products and services is highly competitive. We compete with several companies. Many of these
companies are better capitalized than our company and their offerings may be substantially less expensive than the
cost of our services. We may not be able to maintain or improve our current market position against these and other
competitors.
Additionally, there are few barriers to entry in our industry. Some of our material is based on nonproprietary concepts
and methods that may not be afforded significant protection under intellectual property laws. We anticipate new
entrants into our industry providing products and services comparable to ours at reduced rates. Further, established
companies with high brand recognition and extensive experience providing various educational products to the market
may develop products and services that are competitive with ours. Such increased competition could adversely affect
our market share and potential growth and hinder our ability to maintain pricing, which could adversely affect our
revenue and profitability.
If we make any acquisitions, they may disrupt or have a negative impact on our business, dilute stockholder value
or divert management’s attention
31
If we make acquisitions in the future, funding permitting, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, we
could have difficulty integrating the acquired company’s assets, personnel and operations with our own. We do not
anticipate that any acquisitions or mergers we may enter into in the future would result in a change of control of the
company. In addition, the key personnel of the acquired business may not be willing to work for us. We cannot predict
the effect expansion may have on our core business. Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition,
the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees and increase our
expenses. In addition to the risks described above, acquisitions are accompanied by a number of inherent risks,
including, without limitation, the following:
 the difficulty of integrating acquired products, services or operations;
 the potential disruption of the ongoing businesses and distraction of our management and the
management of acquired companies;
 difficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;
 the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration
of new management personnel;
 the potential inability or failure to achieve additional sales and enhance our customer base through
cross-marketing of the products to new and existing customers;
 the effect of any government regulations which relate to the business acquired;
 potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses or product lines, or the need to
spend significant amounts to retool, reposition or modify the marketing and sales of acquired
products or operations, or the defense of any litigation, whether or not successful, resulting from
actions of the acquired company prior to our acquisition; and
 potential expenses under the labor, environmental and other laws of various jurisdictions.
Our business could be severely impaired if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these
risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition, many of which cannot be presently identified.
These risks and problems could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, increase our
expenses and adversely affect our results of operations.
The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to contain it have significantly adversely affected, and are likely to
continue to significantly adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows,
liquidity and stock price.
An outbreak of infectious respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus known as COVID-19 was first detected in
China in December 2019 and has now been detected globally. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared
the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 has resulted in numerous deaths, travel restrictions, closed
international borders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, disruption of and delays in
healthcare service preparation and delivery, prolonged quarantines and the imposition of both local and more
widespread “work from home” measures, cancellations, supply chain disruptions, and lower consumer demand, as
well as general concern and uncertainty. The ongoing spread of COVID-19 has had, and is expected to continue to
have, a material adverse impact on local economies in the affected jurisdictions and also on the global economy, as
cross border commercial activity and market sentiment are increasingly impacted by the outbreak and government
and other measures seeking to contain its spread. The impact of COVID-19, and other infectious illness outbreaks that
may arise in the future, could adversely affect individual issuers and capital markets in ways that cannot necessarily
be foreseen. In addition, actions taken by government and quasi-governmental authorities and regulators throughout
the world in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, including significant fiscal and monetary policy changes, may affect
the value, volatility, pricing and liquidity of some investments or other assets, including those held by or invested in
by the company. Public health crises caused by the COVID-19 outbreak may exacerbate other pre-existing political,
32
social and economic risks in certain countries or globally. The duration of the COVID-19 outbreak and its ultimate
impact on the company and, on the global economy, cannot be determined with certainty. The COVID-19 pandemic
and its effects may last for an extended period of time and could result in significant and continued declines in global
financial markets, higher default rates, and a substantial economic downturn or recession. The foregoing could disrupt
the operations of the company’s service providers, adversely affect the company’s stock price, and negatively impact
the company’s performance and your investment in the company. The extent to which COVID-19 will affect the
company and its service providers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be
predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions taken to
contain COVID-19. Given the significant economic and financial market disruptions associated with the COVID-19
pandemic, the company’s results of operations could be adversely impacted.
If we experience rapid growth and we are not able to manage this growth successfully, this inability to manage the
growth could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Rapid growth places a significant strain on our financial, operational, and managerial resources. While we engage in
strategic and operational planning to adequately manage anticipated growth, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to implement and subsequently improve operations and financial systems successfully and in a timely manner to
fully manage our growth. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our growth and any inability to
successfully manage growth could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operation.
Offering and Securities Risks
We can provide no assurances as to our future financial performance or the investment result of a purchase of our
Common Stock.
Any projected results of operations involve significant risks and uncertainty, should be considered speculative, and
depend on various assumptions which may not be correct. The future performance of our company and the return on
our Common Stock depends on a complex series of events that are beyond our control and that may or may not occur.
Actual results for any period may or may not approximate any assumptions that are made and may differ significantly
from such assumptions. We can provide no assurance or prediction as to our future profitability or to the ultimate
success of an investment in our Common Stock. If we become a public reporting company, we are subject to new
corporate governance and internal control reporting requirements, and our costs related to compliance with, or our
failure to comply with existing and future requirements, could adversely affect our business.
We may face new corporate governance requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Act
of 2010, as well as new rules and regulations subsequently adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) and the Public company Accounting Oversight Board. These laws, rules, and regulations continue to evolve
and may become increasingly stringent in the future. We will be required to evaluate our internal control over financial
reporting under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Section 404”). We will be a smaller reporting
company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act. Section 404 requires us to include an internal control
report with our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The report must include management’s assessment of the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the fiscal year. This report must also include disclosure
of any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that we have identified. Failure to comply, or
any adverse results from such evaluation, could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have
an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities. We will strive to continuously evaluate and improve our control
structure to help ensure that we comply with Section 404. The financial cost of compliance with these laws, rules, and
regulations is expected to remain substantial. We cannot assure you that we will be able to fully comply with these
laws, rules, and regulations that address corporate governance, internal control reporting, and similar matters. Failure
to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition,
and the value of our securities.
If we become a public company, we will have significant operating costs relating to compliance requirements and
our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.
33
Our management has only limited experience operating as a public company. To operate effectively, we will be
required to continue to implement changes in certain aspects of our business and develop, manage, and train
management level and other employees to comply with on-going public company requirements. Failure to take such
actions, or delay in the implementation thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, impose
various requirements on public companies, including requiring establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure
and financial controls and changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need
to devote a substantial amount of time to these new compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations will
increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly.
Because there is no existing market for our Common Stock, the Pre-Money Valuation in which we complete the
sale of Shares contemplated in this Offering may not be indicative of the market price of our Common Stock after
the offering, which may decrease significantly.
There is currently no public market for our Common Stock, and an active trading market may not develop or be
sustained after this offering or in the foreseeable future. The valuation under which this Offering is made may not be
indicative of the market price for our Common Stock after the financing if and when the company completes a reverse
merger. If our shares become publicly traded, we cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in our company
will lead to the development of an active trading market, and the lack of an active market might reduce the value of
your shares and impair your ability to sell your shares at the time or price at which you wish to sell them.
If shares of our Common Stock were publicly traded, the market price of our Common Stock could fluctuate
significantly as a result of a number of factors, including:
 fluctuations in our financial performance
 economic and stock market conditions generally and specifically as they may impact us, participants
in our industry or comparable companies
 changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts following our Common
Stock or comparable companies
 earnings and other announcements by, and changes in market evaluations of, us, participants in our
industry or comparable companies
 changes in business or regulatory conditions affecting us, participants in our industry or comparable
companies
 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles
 announcements or implementation by our competitors or us of acquisitions, technological
innovations or new products, or other strategic actions by our competitors
 trading volume of our Common Stock or the sale of stock by our management team, directors or
principal shareholders
 limited “public float” in the hands of a small number of persons whose sales (or lack of sales) could
result in positive or negative pricing pressure on the market price for our Common Stock
 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results
 our ability to obtain adequate working capital financing
34
 changes in market valuations of similar companies
 changes in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings, enforcement and legal actions
 loss of any strategic relationships
 additions or departures of key management personnel
 actions by our stockholders (including transactions in our shares)
 speculation in the press or investment community
 increases in market interest rates, which may increase our cost of capital
 changes in our industry
 competitive pricing pressures; and
 our ability to execute our business plan and other external factors.
In addition, the securities markets have from time -to -time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that
are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially
and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock.
If we experience rapid growth and we are not able to manage this growth successfully, this inability to manage the
growth could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Rapid growth places a significant strain on our financial, operational, and managerial resources. While we engage in
strategic and operational planning to adequately manage anticipated growth, there can be no assurance that we will be
able to implement and subsequently improve operations and financial systems successfully and in a timely manner to
fully manage our growth. There can be no assurance that we will be able to manage our growth and any inability to
successfully manage growth could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operation.
If we undertake business combinations and acquisitions, they may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business,
dilute stockholder value or divert management’s attention.
We may support our growth through acquisitions of complementary businesses, services or technologies in the future.
Future acquisitions involve risks, such as:
 misjudgment with respect to the value, return on investment or strategic fit of any acquired
operations or assets
 challenges associated with integrating acquired technologies, operations and cultures of acquired
companies
 exposure to unforeseen liabilities
 diversion of management and other resources from day-to-day operations
 possible loss of key employees, customers, suppliers and partners
 higher than expected transaction costs
35
 potential loss of commercial relationships and customers based on their concerns regarding the
acquired business or technologies, and
 additional dilution to our existing stockholders if we use our capital stock as consideration for such
acquisitions.
As a result of these risks, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of any acquisition. If we are unsuccessful
in completing or integrating acquisitions, we may be required to reevaluate our growth strategy and we may have
incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete and
integrate the acquisitions.
Future business combinations could involve the acquisition of significant intangible assets. We may need to record
write-downs from future impairments of identified intangible assets and goodwill. These accounting charges would
reduce any future reported earnings or increase a reported loss. In addition, we could use substantial portions of our
available cash, including some or substantially all of the proceeds from this offering, to pay the purchase price for
acquisitions. Subject to the provisions of our existing indebtedness, it is possible that we could incur additional debt
or issue additional equity securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to
suffer significant dilution.
We do not anticipate paying any dividends on our Common Stock or Preferred Stock.
We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our Common Stock or Preferred Stock in the foreseeable future.
If we do not pay cash dividends, you could receive a return on your investment in our Preferred Stock only if the fair
market price of our Preferred Stock has increased when you sell your shares. We are not a publicly traded company
and therefore the market for our shares is illiquid which may make it difficult to sell shares.
Lack of Registration; Limited Liquidity; No Secondary Market.
The Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or under the securities or “blue sky” laws of any state
and, therefore, are subject to transfer restrictions. In connection with your purchase of Shares, you must represent that
you are purchasing the Shares for investment purposes only and not with a view toward resale or distribution. Neither
the company nor the Directors have any plans or has assumed any obligation to register the Shares. Accordingly, the
Shares may only be transferred in accordance with this Agreement and the Bylaws.
An investment in the company is suitable only for sophisticated investors who have no need for current liquidity. An
investment in the company provides limited liquidity since Shares are not freely transferable and holders of Common
Stock (“Common Stock Shareholders”) may not withdraw capital from the company. There is no secondary market
for Shares. The ability of the company to make distributions depends on its ability to attract and retain customers,
which in turn depends on a number of factors, including some beyond the company’s control. Nobody guarantees
that you will receive payments and you might lose some or all of your investment.
No Public Trading Market.
There is no public trading market whatsoever for the Shares. The Shares are not quoted in the over-the-counter
markets or listed on any stock exchange. Therefore, outstanding Shares cannot be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise
transferred except in privately arranged transactions and then only if the transaction complies with the terms of this
Agreement and the Bylaws. The company provides no assurance that an active trading market will develop in the
future. If you purchase Shares in the offering, you may not be able to resell them.
There can be no assurance that any form of merger, combination, or sale of the company will take place, or that any
merger, combination, or sale would provide liquidity for the Purchasers. Furthermore, the Corporation may be unable
to register securities for resale by the Shareholders for legal, commercial, regulatory, market-related or other reasons.
Purchasers could be unable to sell the Shares.

36
U.S. REGULATORY MATTERS
Regulation of Blockchain technology and digital assets is being contemplated by the United States at the federal level
through a number of regulatory agencies, as well as in respect of certain individual states. However, at present, the
United States does not have a clear or workable regulatory infrastructure in respect of digital assets, instead relying
largely on existing securities laws. In contrast, globally, many jurisdictions, including the EU and Australia, are
actively pursuing regulation that meets the specific needs of the digital asset and crypto currency markets, ensuring
that investors and other stakeholders are well-protected.
Aurox has considered whether it is required to register, in any capacity, under the relevant securities, commodity
futures or derivatives legislation of the United States and specifically whether the Company is an “investment
company” under the laws of the United States.
Registration as either a broker or dealer under Section 3(a)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act or as an investment company
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 turns, as an initial matter, on whether or not the Company supports,
custodies, intermediates, or facilitates, in any fashion, transactions involving “securities,” as defined in section 2(a)(1)
of the Securities Act of 1933.
In particular, the Company performs internal due diligence in respect of supported digital assets, as well as digital
assets that have been proposed for inclusion on the Company’s platform, to determine the potential regulatory
treatment of such digital assets.
The Company’s platform currently only facilitates ‘spot’ transactions in digital assets. The Company does not provide
any digital asset transactions on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. Spot transactions are not considered Retail
Commodity Transactions, and therefore the Company is not subject to the registration and CFTC oversight
considerations outlined above.
The Company’s conclusion that it is not subject to the aforementioned additional CFTC oversight and registration
provisions is based upon (a) the plain language of the CEA as well as (b) the Company’s ongoing review and analysis
of relevant CFTC guidance.
Notwithstanding these due diligence efforts, the Company recognizes that the legal regime surrounding digital assets
in the U.S. is evolving. Digital assets are a relatively new asset class, and the SEC and CFTC have not developed
definitive and comprehensive regulatory regimes targeted specifically to digital assets. Rather, the SEC has
communicated to industry participants that it will apply existing securities laws, including the four-part Howey Test
developed by the U.S. Supreme Court for determining whether an “investment contract” constitutes a security, to
digital assets.
Given that the fact-based Howey Test is almost 75 years old, was not designed with digital assets in mind, and remains
largely legally ‘untested’ with very limited case law in this particular context, it is possible that the SEC could come
to a different conclusion than the Company in respect of a particular digital asset.
A particular crypto asset’s status as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty
and if the Company is unable to properly characterize a crypto asset, the Company may be subject to regulatory
scrutiny, investigations, fines, and other penalties, which may adversely affect the Company’s business, operating
results, and financial condition.
The SEC and its staff have taken the position that certain crypto assets fall within the definition of a “security” under
the U.S. federal securities laws. The SEC generally does not provide advance guidance or confirmation on the status
of any particular crypto asset as a security. Furthermore, the SEC’s views in this area have evolved over time and it is
difficult to predict the direction or timing of any continuing evolution. It is also possible that a change in the governing
administration or the appointment of new SEC commissioners could substantially impact the views of the SEC and
its staff.
37
In public statements, though not formal rulemaking, certain SEC officials have indicated their view that certain digital
assets are securities. Indeed, particularly in respect of the SEC, much of the approach with respect to digital assets has
emphasized enforcement over rulemaking. However, public statements by senior SEC officials (which again are
distinct from official policy statements) have indicated that the SEC does not intend to take the position that Bitcoin
or Ethereum are securities (in their current form). Senior SEC officials have not provided similar guidance on crypto
assets beyond Bitcoin and Ethereum, resulting in significant uncertainty with respect to essentially all other crypto
assets, including certain assets that the company may utilize.
In addition, it is possible that the SEC, CFTC, or other state or federal regulator could publish additional regulatory
guidance that alters the Company’s regulatory obligations, or that the U.S. implements a comprehensive regulatory
regime in respect of digital asset businesses. Such developments could materially alter the Company’s registration
requirements, require it to remove certain digital assets from its platform or require it to cease certain aspects of its
operations.
While Aurox does not currently offer lending or margin-based products, the Company is aware of, and closely
monitoring, recent industry developments pertaining to adverse financial circumstances impacting certain digital
asset-focused institutions. Though Aurox’s business model, revenue structure and risk profile are, and will remain,
distinct from such institutions, in the event that the Company develops such lending or margin-related products in the
future, the Company will seek to diligently follow any associated regulations, guidance and other
developments. Furthermore, while Aurox is not an exchange and does not itself offer such products or services, the
Company collaborates with exchange providers with respect to certain Aurox Terminal services. As a result, the
Company is closely monitoring conditions impacting such exchange entities.
Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
If you are considering the purchase of our Common Stock, you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the
particular U.S. federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our
Common Stock, as well as the consequences to you arising under other U.S. federal tax laws and the laws of any other
taxing jurisdiction.

FINANCIAL DISCUSSION
Financial statements
Our financial statements can be found in Exhibit B to the Form C of which this offering memorandum forms a part.
The financial statements dated November 30, 2021, to March 31, 2022, cover the date of formation to the end of the
company’s fiscal year and were audited by RBSM LLP. The interim financial statements dated April 1, 2022, through
September 30, 2022, were supplied by the company and have not been audited, nor do they include the notes to the
Financial Statements. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statement
related notes included in this offering memorandum. The following discussion includes information based on Aurox’s
unaudited operating data and is subject to change once they have completed their fiscal year ending March 30, 2023,
at which point Aurox will prepare their financial statements and their accountant will complete a financial audit of
those statements.
The company’s net losses for the year ended March 31, 2022, were $473,423. Aurox Holdings currently does not
have a revenue stream and is funded by the Founders and from the $5,000,000 raised during the Regulation D private
offering conducted during Q1 2022. On March 31, 2022, the company had working capital in the amount of
$3,587,523.
Additionally, the company’s audited financials did not include any expenses related to cost of goods.
The company’s operating expenses consist of licensing fees, payroll, professional services, marketing and advertising,
general and administrative costs. Operating expenses for fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, amounted to $473,423.
Since the end of the period covered by the financial statements, the company’s primary focus is on increasing the
number of users; therefore they have not started charging for any of their services. The operating losses for April 1-
September 30, 2022 were $2,600,043.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
To date, the company has not made any profits and is still a “development stage company.” While some financial
resources have come from a private placement offering, this represents only a fraction of the money needed to operate
the company, and profits are not likely for some time. Currently the company does not have any revenue streams and
therefore does not have any sales data. The company has recorded losses from the time of inception in the total amount
of $3,073,466.
The company was initially capitalized by equity investments from its shareholders in the amount of $2,500,000, plus
additional loans made by the founders. There are no agreements in place documenting these loans nor the associated
terms.
The company had approximately $1,445,240 cash on hand as of September 30, 2022. Currently, we estimate our burn
rate (net cash out) to be on average of $150,000 per month.
Indebtedness
The company does not have any indebtedness.

On January 23, 2022, the company and Giorgi Khazaradze, Taras Motsnyy and Ziga Naglic entered into a Founder’s

On January 6, 2022 the company entered into an “Intellectual Property License Agreement” (the “IP License
Agreement”), with Aurox LLC, a Wyoming entity formed and currently owned by the company’s Founders (“Aurox
LLC”). Aurox LLC was established in 2018 to develop certain intellectual property and other assets now utilized in
the Aurox Ecosystem. The IP License Agreement covers certain technology and intellectual assets, including prior
work related to the Aurox Terminal, Proprietary Indicators and Aurox Backend, upon which facets of the current
Aurox Ecosystem are based (collectively, the “LLC Technology”). Although the company maintains the LLC
Technology, all improvements, developments, advances and subsequent iterations of the LLC Technology occur
within the company and are therefore directly controlled by the company. Pursuant to the IP License Agreement,
Aurox LLC granted a personal, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, right and license
to use the LLC Technology for any businesses in which the company is now or hereafter engaged, and to: (a) create
derivatives of the LLC Technology; and (b) use, reproduce, distribute, perform and display the LLC Technology
Pursuant to the IP License Agreement, the company is obligated to pay an annual fee of $120,000 to Aurox LLC for
the LLC Technology.
On November 7, 2022, the company entered into a Token License Agreement (the “Token License Agreement”) in
respect of the Aurox Token with SWT Development Limited, a Limited Liability company incorporated in Masdar
City, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (“SWT”), as well as Ziga, one of the company’s Founders, in his capacity as
an individual, resident in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. SWT, an entity wholly-owned and controlled by Ziga, owns
all legal rights to the Aurox Token. The Aurox Token provides utility within the Aurox Ecosystem, including in
respect of the Aurox Wallet and Aurox Terminal. The Token License Agreement grants a non-revocable, exclusive,
transferable, perpetual worldwide license during the term of the Agreement to use the Aurox Token and related token
assets including any trademarks for any lawful purpose within the Aurox Ecosystem, including to provide utility with
regard to the Aurox Wallet and Aurox Terminal.
No fees or royalties are payable in any form under the Token License Agreement and the initial term of the license is
for thirty (30) years and is subject to automatic renewal for subsequent thirty (30) year periods, without additional fee
or royalty payment due.
46
The company contracts some developers who are employed by Adtelligence, but pays such individuals directly. Thus,
the Company does not currently and does not anticipate in the future making payments to Adtelligence.
We have adopted a policy that any transactions with directors, officers or entities of which they are also officers or
directors or in which they have a financial interest, will only be on terms consistent with industry standards and
approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of the Board of Directors and based upon a determination that
these transactions are on terms no less favorable to us than those which could be obtained by unaffiliated third parties.
This policy could be terminated in the future. In addition, interested directors may be counted in determining the
presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof which approves such a transaction.

Common Stock
Holders of our Common Stock are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote
of the stockholders, and do not have cumulative voting rights. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any
outstanding shares of preferred stock, holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive ratably such dividends, if any,
as may be declared from time to time by our Board of Directors out of funds legally available for dividend payments.
All outstanding, shares of Common Stock are fully paid and non-assessable, and the shares of Common Stock to be
issued upon completion of this offering will be fully paid and non-assessable. The holders of Common Stock have no
preferences or rights of cumulative voting, conversion, or pre-emptive or other subscription rights. There are no
redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the Common Stock. In the event of any liquidation, dissolution
or winding-up of our affairs, holders of Common Stock will be entitled to share ratably in any of our assets remaining
after payment or provision for payment of all of our debts and obligations and after liquidation payments to holders
of outstanding shares of preferred stock, if any.
Preferred Stock
The current amended and restated certificate authorizes the Company to issue 10,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock.
The Company has designated ten (10) shares of its Series X Preferred Stock, of which three (3) shares have been
issued, one to each of the Company’s Founders. The Series X Preferred Stock is not convertible and does not provide
the holder with any equity interest in the Company. The Series X Preferred Stock entitles each of the Founders the
rights to vote to the extent of ten times (10x) of the Common Stock that they each own at any general or special
meeting of shareholders.
Our Board of Directors has the authority, without further stockholder authorization, to issue from time to time shares
of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the terms, limitations, relative rights and preferences and variations
of each series. Although we have no present plans to issue additional shares of preferred stock, the issuance of shares
of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to purchase such shares, could decrease the amount of earnings and assets
available for distribution to the holders of Common Stock, could adversely affect the rights and powers, including
voting rights, of the Common Stock, and could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control
of us or an unsolicited acquisition proposal.
What it Means to be a Minority Holder
As an investor in this round of Common stock of the company, you will not have any rights in regard to the
corporate actions of the company, including additional issuances of securities, company repurchases of securities, a
sale of the company or its significant assets, or company transactions with related parties.
Transferability of Securities
For a year, the securities can only be resold:
 In an IPO or other public offering registered with the SEC;
 To the company;
 To an accredited investor; and
 To a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent, to a trust controlled by the purchaser,
to a trust created for the benefit of a member of the family of the purchaser or the equivalent, or in
connection with the death or divorce of the purchaser or other similar circumstance.
50
Transfer Agent
The company has selected VStock, an SEC-registered securities transfer agent, to act as its transfer agent. They will
be responsible for keeping track of who owns the company’s securities.

51
DILUTION AND ANTI-DILUTION
The shares of Common Stock purchased by investors during the Regulation D offering are subject to price protection.
Investors should understand the potential for dilution. The investor’s stake in a company could be diluted due to the
company issuing additional shares. In other words, when the company issues more shares, the percentage of the
company that you own will go down, even though the value of the company may go up. You will own a smaller piece
of a larger company. This increase in number of shares outstanding could result from a stock offering (such as an
initial public offering, another crowdfunding round, a venture capital round, angel investment), employees exercising
stock options, or by conversion of certain instruments (e.g., convertible bonds, preferred shares or warrants) into stock.
If the company decides to issue more shares, an investor could experience value dilution, with each share being worth
less than before, and control dilution, with the total percentage an investor owns being less than before. There may
also be earnings dilution, with a reduction in the amount earned per share (though this typically occurs only if the
company offers dividends, and most early-stage companies are unlikely to offer dividends, preferring to invest any
earnings into the company).
The type of dilution that hurts early-stage investors most occurs when the company sells more shares in a “down
round,” meaning at a lower valuation than in earlier offerings. An example of how this might occur is as follows
(numbers are for illustrative purposes only):
 In June 2020 Jane invests $20,000 for shares that represent 2% of a company valued at $1 million.
 In December, the company is doing very well and sells $5 million in shares to venture capitalists on
a valuation (before the new investment) of $10 million. Jane now owns only 1.3% of the company
but her stake is worth $200,000.
 In June 2021, the company has run into serious problems and in order to stay afloat it raises $1
million at a valuation of only $2 million (the “down round”). Jane now owns only 0.89% of the
company and her stake is worth only $26,660.
This type of dilution might also happen upon conversion of convertible notes into shares. Typically, the terms of
convertible notes issued by early-stage companies provide that in the event of another round of financing, the holders
of the convertible notes get to convert their notes into equity at a “discount” to the price paid by the new investors,
i.e., they get more shares than the new investors would for the same price. Additionally, convertible notes may have
a “price cap” on the conversion price, which effectively acts as a share price ceiling. Either way, the holders of the
convertible notes get more shares for their money than new investors. In the event that the financing is a “down round”
the holders of the convertible notes will dilute existing equity holders, and even more than the new investors do,
because they get more shares for their money. Investors should pay careful attention to the aggregate total amount of
convertible notes that the company has issued (and may issue in the future, and the terms of those notes.
If you are making an investment expecting to own a certain percentage of the company or expecting each share to
hold a certain amount of value, it’s important to realize how the value of those shares can decrease by actions taken
by the company. Dilution can make drastic changes to the value of each share, ownership percentage, voting control,
and earnings per share.
Valuation
Pre-money valuation: $75,000,000.
Valuation details: The valuation was decided based on competitor analysis, projections of revenue, the state of the
company, previous round raise and the value of the strategic investors participating in the corporate development.
As discussed in “Dilution” above, the valuation of the company will determine the amount by which the investor’s
stake is diluted in the future. An early-stage company typically sells its shares (or grants options over its shares) to its
52
founders and early employees at a very low cash cost because they are, in effect, putting their “sweat equity” into the
company. When the company seeks cash investments from outside investors, like you, the new investors typically pay
a much larger sum for their shares than the founders or earlier investors, which means that the cash value of your stake
is immediately diluted because each share of the same type is worth the same amount, and you paid more for your
shares than earlier investors did for theirs.
There are several ways to value a company, and none of them is perfect and all of them involve a certain amount of
guesswork. The same method can produce a different valuation if used by a different person.
Liquidation Value — The amount for which the assets of the company can be sold, minus the liabilities owed,
e.g., the assets of a bakery include the cake mixers, ingredients, baking tins, etc. The liabilities of a bakery
include the cost of rent or mortgage on the bakery. However, this value does not reflect the potential value
of a business, e.g., the value of the secret recipe. The value for most startups lies in their potential, as many
early-stage companies do not have many assets (they probably need to raise funds through a securities
offering in order to purchase some equipment).
Book Value — This is based on analysis of the company’s financial statements, usually looking at the
company’s balance sheet as prepared by its accountants. However, the balance sheet only looks at costs (i.e.,
what was paid for the asset), and does not consider whether the asset has increased in value over time. In
addition, some intangible assets, such as patents, trademarks or trade names, are very valuable but are not
usually represented at their market value on the balance sheet.
Earnings Approach — This is based on what the investor will pay (the present value) for what the investor
expects to obtain in the future (the future return), taking into account inflation, the lost opportunity to
participate in other investments, the risk of not receiving the return. However, predictions of the future are
uncertain, and valuation of future returns is a best guess.
Different methods of valuation produce a different answer as to what your investment is worth. Typically, liquidation
value and book value will produce a lower valuation than the earnings approach. However, the earnings approach is
also most likely to be risky as it is based on many assumptions about the future, while the liquidation value and book
value are much more conservative.
Future investors (including people seeking to acquire the company) may value the company differently. They may
use a different valuation method, or different assumptions about the company’s business and its market. Different
valuations may mean that the value assigned to your investment changes. It frequently happens that when a large
institutional investor such as a venture capitalist makes an investment in a company, it values the company at a lower
price than the initial investors did. If this happens, the value of the investment will go down.

INVESTING PROCESS
Information Regarding Length of Time of Offering
Investment Cancellations: Investors will have up to 48 hours prior to the Termination Date to change their
minds and cancel their investment commitments for any reason. Once the offering period is within 48 hours
of ending, investors will not be able to cancel for any reason, even if they make a commitment during this
period.
Notifications: Investors will receive periodic notifications regarding certain events pertaining to this offering,
such as the company reaching its offering target, the company making an early closing, the company making
material changes to its Form C, and the offering closing at its target date.
Material Changes: Material changes to an offering include but are not limited to:
A change in minimum offering amount, change in security price, change in management, etc. If an issuing
company makes a material change to the offering terms or other information disclosed, investors will be
given five business days to reconfirm their investment commitment. If investors do not reconfirm, their
investment will be cancelled, and the funds will be returned.
Rolling and Early Closings: The company may elect to undertake rolling closings, or an early closing after
it has received investment interests for its target offering amount. During a rolling closing, those investors
that have committed funds will be provided five days’ notice prior to acceptance of their subscriptions, release
of funds to the company, and issuance of securities to the investors. During this time, the company may
continue soliciting investors and receiving additional investment commitments. Investors should note that if
investors have already received their securities, they will not be required to reconfirm upon the filing of a
material amendment to the Form C. In an early closing, the offering will terminate upon the new target date,
which must be at least five days from the date of the notice.
Closings Generally. Upon receipt of the Target Amount in escrow, held with tZero ATS as escrow agent,
investor funds will be disbursed to the company, and securities shall be disbursed to investors, following
release from escrow held at the intermediary.
Credit Card Payments. Investors using a credit card to invest must represent and warrant to cancel any
investment commitment(s) by submitting a request through the Intermediary at least 48 hours prior to the
Offering Deadline, instead of attempting to claim fraud or claw back their committed funds. If the investor
does not cancel an investment commitment before the 48-hour period prior to the Offering Deadline, the
funds will be released to the Issuer and the investor will receive their Securities.
Investor Limitations
Investors are limited in how much they can invest on all crowdfunding offerings during any 12-month period. The
limitation on how much they can invest depends on their net worth (excluding the value of their primary residence)
and annual income. If either their annual income or net worth is less than $124,000, then during any 12-month period,
they can invest up to the greater of either $2,500 or 5% of the greater of their annual income or Net worth. If both
their annual income and net worth are equal to or more than $124,000, then during any 12-month period, they can
invest up to 10% of annual income or net worth, whichever is greater, but their investments cannot exceed $124,000.
If the investor is an “accredited investor” as defined under Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act, as
amended, no investment limits apply.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Aurox Holdings, Inc.

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Aurox Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) as of March 31, 2022, and the
related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the period from November 30, 2021 (Inception)
through March 31, 2022, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion,
the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2022, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from November 30, 2021 (Inception) through March 31, 2022, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Substantial doubt about the Company’s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared to assume that the Company will continue as a going concern. As
discussed in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements, the Company must raise significant funds in order to pay its
outstanding debt and meet its other obligations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
continue as a going concern. Management’s evaluation of the events and conditions and management’s plans regarding these
matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due
to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over
financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis,
evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial
statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

AUROX HOLDINGS INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2022

1. Nature of Operations

Aurox Holdings Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on November 30, 2021. The
Company’s three founders (the “Founders”) each initially owned approximately one-third of the initial capitalization. The
Company intends to market the Aurox all-in-one cryptocurrency terminal (the “Aurox Trading Platform”) that integrates data,
content, and strategies to help crypto traders make better decisions. The Company licenses the Aurox Trading Platform from
Aurox, LLC, a company controlled by the Founders.

COVID-19

The recent outbreak of the coronavirus, also known as “COVID-19”, has spread across the globe and is impacting worldwide
economic activity. Conditions surrounding the coronavirus continue to rapidly evolve and government authorities have
implemented emergency measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. These measures, which include the implementation of
travel bans, self-imposed quarantine periods and social distancing, have caused material disruption to business globally
resulting in an economic slowdown. Global equity markets have experienced significant volatility and weakness. Governments
and central banks have reacted with significant monetary and fiscal interventions designed to stabilize economic conditions.

There are significant uncertainties with respect to future developments and impact to the Company related to the COVID-19
pandemic, including the duration, severity and scope of the outbreak and the measures taken by governments and businesses
to contain the pandemic. While the impact of COVID-19 is expected to be temporary, the current circumstances are dynamic
and the impacts of COVID-19 on the Company’s business operations cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. As at the
approval date of these consolidated financial statements, the outbreak and the related mitigation measures have taken and the
extent to which these events may further impact the Company’s business activities will depend on future developments, such
as the ultimate geographic spread of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions, business disruptions, and the
effectiveness of actions taken in United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease. These events are highly
uncertain and as such, the Company cannot determine the ultimate financial impacts at this time. Any deterioration in the
current situation could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows in 2022.

2. Financial Condition and Going Concern

While these financial statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business,
adverse conditions could cast doubt upon the validity of this assumption. At March 31, 2022 the Company has working capital
in the amount of $3,587,523, and has incurred losses since inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $573,423. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance
of the financial statements.

Through March 31, 2022, the Company has raised gross proceeds in the amount of $4,825,000 from the sale of its common
stock. In order to meet its corporate and administrative expenses for the coming year, the Company will be required to raise
funds through additional financing. Although the Company has been successful in raising funds, there is no certainty that the
Company will be successful in the future.

If the going concern assumption was not appropriate for these financial statements, then adjustments might be necessary to the
carrying values of assets and liabilities, the reported loss and the balance sheet classifications used. These adjustments could
be material. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the Company be
unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2022

3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as
described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying financial statements and notes.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of Aurox Holdings Inc. and are presented in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

Prepaid expenses

Prepaid expenses represent future expenses paid in advance, until the associated benefits are realized, the future expense
remains at current asset within the next twelve months and non-current asset after twelve months. Since prepaid expenses are
categorized as “current and non-current” assets, the benefits associated with the products or services paid for upfront are
expected to be used for the next twelve months and thereafter. Once the benefits of the assets are gradually realized, the prepaid
expense is reduced as the asset is expensed off on the statement of operations.

Digital Assets Translations and Impairments

Digital assets are included in the balance sheets as current assets, and are recorded at cost less impairment. The Company
assesses impairment of digital assets quarterly if the fair value of digital assets is less than its cost basis. The Company
recognizes impairment losses on digital assets caused by decreases in fair value using the lowest U.S. dollar spot price of the
related digital asset as of each reporting date. Such impairment in the value of digital assets are recorded as a component of
costs and expenses in our statements of operations. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new
cost basis of the asset. Gains and subsequent reversal of impairment losses are not permitted.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value
of its financial instruments and has adopted paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
(“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification
establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3)
broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by
paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are described below: Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.
Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.
Financial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more
than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
measurement of the instrument.

B-9

AUROX HOLDINGS INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2022

Our short-term financial instruments, including cash, other assets and accounts payable and accrued expenses consist primarily
of instruments without extended maturities, the fair value of which, based on management’s estimates, reasonably approximate
their book value. The fair value of our notes and advances payable is based on management estimates and reasonably
approximates their book value based on their current maturity.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant
estimates include the recoverability and useful lives of long-lived assets, the fair value of the Company’s stock, stock-based
compensation, intangible assets impairment and the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets. Actual results may differ
from these estimates.

Forward Stock Split

Effective December 30, 2021, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a 10,010-for-1 stock split of the Company’s
common stock. The Company had 999 shares of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the forward split, and
10,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding immediately after the split, an increase of 9,999,001. Ten additional shares
were issued to the common stockholders in order to round the total shares outstanding to 10,000,000. All share or per share
information is stated on a post-forward split basis.

Net Loss per Common Share

The Company computes net loss per share under Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share
(“ASC 260-10”). Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock. Diluted net loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and common
stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. There is no effect on diluted loss per share since there are no common
stock equivalents outstanding as of March 31, 2022.

Revenue Recognition

It is the Company’s policy that revenue from product sales or services will be recognized in accordance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board “FASB” Accounting Standards Codification “ASC” 606. A five-step analysis a must be met as
outlined in Topic 606: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii)
determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and (v) recognize revenue
when (or as) performance obligations are satisfied. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and
allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.

Stock Based Compensation

We recognize the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and
recognize the costs in the consolidated financial statements over the period during which employees are required to provide
services. Share-based compensation cost for stock options are estimated at the grant date based on each option’s fair-value as
calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) option-pricing model. Share-based compensation arrangements may include
stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans.
Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.

Equity instruments issued to those other than employees are recognized pursuant to FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation
– Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU relates to
the accounting for non-employee share-based payments. The amendment in this update expands the scope of Topic 718 to
include all share-based payment transactions in which a grantor acquired goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor’s
own operations by issuing share-based payment awards. The ASU excludes share-based payment awards that relate to: (1)
financing to the issuer; or (2) awards granted in conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract
accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts from Customers. The share-based payments are to be measured at
grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that the entity is obligated to issue when the goods or service has been delivered
or rendered and all other conditions necessary to earn the right to benefit from the equity instruments have been satisfied.

AUROX HOLDINGS INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2022

Comprehensive Income

SFAS No. 130, “Reporting Comprehensive Income,” establishes standards for the reporting and display of comprehensive
income and its components in the consolidated financial statements. Comprehensive income is defined to include all changes
in equity except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners. Among other disclosures, SFAS No.
130 requires that all items that are required to be recognized under current accounting standards as components of
comprehensive income be reported in a financial statement that is displayed with the same prominence as other consolidated
financial statements. As of March 31, 2022, the Company reported no comprehensive income or loss.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of items that have been
included or excluded in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
on the basis of the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their respective financial reporting amounts
(“temporary differences”) at enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.

The Company adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 740-10, which prescribes a
recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return.

Management has evaluated and concluded that there were no material uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the
Company’s financial statements as of March 31, 2022.

Research and development

In accordance with ASC 730, “Research and Development”, the Company expenses all research and development costs as
incurred. The Company had incurred $0 of research and development costs for the period of inception (November 30, 2021)
through March 31, 2022.

Long-Lived Assets

The Company reviews its long-lived assets, including property and equipment and any identifiable intangibles, for impairment
utilizing the guidance set forth in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Board ASC 350 “Intangibles – Goodwill
and Other” and ASC 360 “Property, Plant, and Equipment”. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis
or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in
accordance with Topic ASC 360, “Property, Plant and Equipment”. Recoverability is measured by comparison of the carrying
amount to the future net cash flows which the assets are expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the projected

Cash and cash equivalents

For purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes demand deposits, saving accounts and money
market accounts. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less when
purchased to be cash and cash equivalents.

Related parties

The Company follows the ASC 850-10, Related Party for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party
transactions.

Pursuant to section 850-10-20 the related parties include a) affiliates of the Company; b) entities for which investments in their
equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of
section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c) trusts for the benefit of employees,
such as pension and Income-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d) principal owners of
the Company; e) management of the Company; f) other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might
be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g) other parties that can significantly influence the management
or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can
significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing
its own separate interests.

The financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements,
expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are
eliminated in the preparation of consolidated financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall
include: a) the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b) a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no
amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other
information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the consolidated financial statements;
c) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any
change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d) amount due from or to related
parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.

Commitments and Contingencies

The Company follows the ASC 450-20, Commitments to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as
of the date the consolidated financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company, but which will only be
resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such
assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are
pending against the Company or un-asserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived
merits of any legal proceedings or un-asserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected
to be sought therein.

If the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the
liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. If
the assessment indicates that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable
but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if
determinable and material, would be disclosed.

Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees
would be disclosed. Management does not believe, based upon information available at this time that these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance
that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial position, and results of operations
or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation – Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU relates to the accounting for non-employee share-based payments.
The amendment in this update expands the scope of Topic 718 to include all share-based payment transactions in which a
grantor acquired goods or services to be used or consumed in a grantor’s own operations by issuing share-based payment
awards. The ASU excludes share-based payment awards that relate to: (1) financing to the issuer; or (2) awards granted in
conjunction with selling goods or services to customers as part of a contract accounted for under Topic 606, Revenue from
Contracts from Customers. The share-based payments are to be measured at grant-date fair value of the equity instruments that
the entity is obligated to issue when the goods or service has been delivered or rendered and all other conditions necessary to
earn the right to benefit from the equity instruments have been satisfied. This standard will be effective for public business
entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. We adopted the
provisions of this ASU on October 1, 2019. The adoption had no impact on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial
condition.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the
subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair
value of goodwill under Step 2, current U.S. GAAP requires the performance of procedures to determine the fair value at the
impairment testing date of assets and liabilities (including unrecognized assets and liabilities) following the procedure that
would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead,
the amendments under this ASU require the goodwill impairment test to be performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting
unit with its carrying amount.

An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair
value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The ASU
becomes effective for the Company on October 1, 2018. The amendments in this ASU should be applied on a prospective basis.
Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed. We are evaluating what impact, if any,
the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP
on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting
for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for
financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing
deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by
means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance
is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under
the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. We adopted the provisions
of this ASU on October 1, 2018. The adoption had no impact on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

Accounting Standards Issued, Not Adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on
Financial Instruments (“ASU 2016-13”). This ASU requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for
financial assets. ASU 2016-13 also requires new disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost, loans and
available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning September 1, 2023. Entities will apply
the standard's provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period
in which the guidance is adopted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential effect of this standard on its consolidated
financial statements. The Company does not expect this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial
statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (“ASU 2018-13”), which eliminates, adds and
modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. The amendment is effective for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact this will have on the
consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MARCH 31, 2022

In November 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (“ASU 2018-18”), which clarifies the
interaction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Certain
transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted for under ASC 606 when the counterparty
is a customer. In addition, ASU 2018-18 precludes an entity from presenting consideration from a transaction in a collaborative
arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer for that transaction. ASU 2018-18 should be applied
retrospectively to the date of initial application of ASC 606. This guidance is effective for interim and fiscal periods beginning
after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently assessing the impact this will have on the consolidated financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes: Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (“ASU
2019-12”), which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for
calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The
new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies
the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. The standard is effective for fiscal years and
interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the
standard requires certain changes to be made prospectively, with some changes to be made retrospectively. The Company does
not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-03, “Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments”: The amendments in
this update are to clarify, correct errors in, or make minor improvements to a variety of ASC topics. The changes in ASU 2020-
03 are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practices. The ASU improves various financial instrument
topics in the Codification to increase stakeholder awareness of the amendments and to expedite the improvement process by
making the Codification easier to understand and easier to apply by eliminating inconsistencies and providing clarifications.
The ASU is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 with early application
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance may have on its combined financial
statements.

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06 Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and
Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) related to the measurement and disclosure
requirements for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The pronouncement simplifies and adds
disclosure requirements for the accounting and measurement of convertible instruments and the settlement assessment for
contracts in an entity’s own equity. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2021 and early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that
this standard will have on its combined financial statements.

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt—Modifications and Extinguishments
(Subtopic 470-50), Compensation—Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). ASU 2021-04 clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or
exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after
modification or exchange. The ASU provides guidance to clarify whether an issuer should account for a modification or an
exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange as
(1) an adjustment to equity and, if so, the related earnings per share effects, if any, or (2) an expense and, if so, the manner and
pattern of recognition. ASU 2021-04 is effective for annual beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods
within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently
evaluating the impact that this standard will have on its combined financial statements.

In October 2021, the FASB issued guidance which requires companies to apply Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with
Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers acquired in a
business combination. Public entities must adopt the new guidance for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact and
timing of adoption of this guidance

There are other various updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or
application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results
of operations or cash flows.

The Company evaluates events that have occurred after the balance sheet date but before the consolidated financial statements
are issued. Based upon the evaluation, the Company did not identify any recognized or non-recognized subsequent events that
would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements, except as disclosed below.

4. Intangible Assets – Digital Currency

We expect to receive payment for our services in the form cash and of digital currency, which is maintained in digital wallets;
we also pay certain of our expenses in the form of digital currency. These digital transactions are recorded in USD at the closing
price of the digital currency on the date of each transaction. At period end, the value of each digital currency is then compared
to the closing price in effect on the last day of the period. Any increase in value is recorded as an unrealized gain, and is not
recognized until the digital currency is disposed. Any decrease in value is recorded as an impairment to the value of the
intangible asset. The amounts of digital currencies are summarized in the table below:

 March 31,
 2022
Digital Currency $ 13,043

At March 31, 2022, the Company had recorded unrealized gains in the amount of $5,466; during period of inception through
March 31, 2022, the Company had reserves against future losses in the amount of $5,466.

5. Intangible Assets – Software Capitalization

On January 6, 2022, the Company entered into an intellectual property and license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with
Aurox, LLC (the “Vendor”). The Vendor is owned by the same three individuals as the Company. Pursuant to the License
Agreement, the Company obtained the perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable right and license (the “License”) to use and
create derivatives of exclusive right to use, develop, and certain technology, primarily consisting of the Aurox Terminal. The
Aurox Terminal is a cloud-based software engine that provides to users the ability to analyze, monitor, and chart
cryptocurrencies across multiple centralized and decentralize exchanges. The Aurox Terminal is a non-custodial data only
product, but it does allow users to place orders by linking their already existing centralized exchange accounts or their web3
wallet to the platform. The cost of the License is $10,000 per month. The Company is building additional features and
capabilities into and related to the Aurox Terminal, with the intention of offering a suite of services (the “Platform”) to its
customers via the Company’s website.

The Company hosts the Platform. The Company’s customers will not take possession of the Platform and cannot run the
Platform on their own hardware. For these reasons, pursuant to ASC 985-20, the Platform is considered a software hosting
arrangement and the guidance of ASC 350-40 applies. Pursuant to ASC 350-40, the software development process is broken
down into three stages:

 1) Preliminary project stage: costs are expensed
 2) Application development stage: costs are capitalized
 3) Post-implementation – operation stage: costs are expensed

The Company was familiar with the Platform and with the additional capabilities they intend to develop at the time they
acquired the License, and accordingly there were no preliminary project stage expenses incurred. The further development of
the Platform is anticipated to continue through approximately December 31, 2022, when the Company expects to offer a limited
number of products to its customers. The Company will capitalize all development costs until such time as these service
offerings are made available. During the period from inception (November 30, 2021) through March 31, 2022, the Company
capitalized development costs in the amount $641,011. These costs consisted of engineering fees and salaries.

For guidance regarding the accounting for the License, the Company looked to paragraphs 350-40-15-1 through 15-4C which
states that such a license should be accounted for as the acquisition of an intangible asset and the incurrence of a liability. The
intangible asset acquired shall be recognized and measure in accordance with paragraphs 350-30-25-1 and 350-30-30-1,
respectively. The Company estimated that the Platform will exit the development stage on December 31, 2022, and capitalized
the amount of license fees payable through that date. This resulted in an intangible asset in the amount of $110,000 and a related
liability also in the amount of $110,000. Through March 31, 2022, the Company paid $20,000 of license fees, and the balance
of the liability at March 31, 2022 is $90,000.

3. TECHNOLOGY LICENSE TERMS
3.1 Licensed Aurox Technology Grant. Subject to the restrictions specified in this Section 3.1,
Aurox hereby grants to Aurox Holdings a personal, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, non-transferable, right and license to use any Licensed Aurox Technology for any
businesses in which Aurox Holdings is now or hereafter engaged, and to: (a) create Derivatives of
the Licensed Aurox Technology; and (b) use, reproduce, distribute, perform and display the
Licensed Aurox Technology and Derivatives (made pursuant to subsection (a) above) of the
Licensed Aurox Technology. Except as expressly set forth in Section 3.3 (Procurement Rights),
no right is granted hereunder to Aurox Holdings to sublicense or disclose any of the Licensed
Aurox Technology to any third Person, other than the sublicensing of Software in object code form
in connection with the sale of Aurox Holdings’ products or services.
3.2 License Fee. Unless and until the foregoing right and license is terminated as provided
herein, Aurox Holdings shall pay to Aurox a license fee (the “License Fee”) of $120,000 per annum,
payable in advance in equal monthly installments. Failure to pay the License Fee within thirty (30)
days of the due date thereof shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
3.3 Procurement Rights.
(a) Subject to the restrictions in this Article 3, and without limiting its other rights
hereunder, Aurox Holdings may sublicense and disclose to any of its suppliers, prospective
E-5
suppliers or third Person joint developers (under appropriate joint development agreements)
the Licensed Technology of the other party solely to the extent reasonably necessary for
the procurement by such party of components, subsystems, sub-assemblies, products
and/or services of the businesses of such party. Such disclosure and/or license may only be
made for a bona fide business purpose for the benefit of Aurox Holdings.
(b) Aurox Holdings agrees that it will not make any portion of Licensed Technology of the
other party available to any such supplier, prospective supplier, or joint developer except
under terms and conditions (including confidentiality, use and disclosure restrictions)
normally used by such party to protect its own intellectual property and proprietary
information of a similar nature.
(c) The rights granted hereunder to Aurox Holdings under this Section 3.3 or otherwise
under this Agreement, may not be exercised in a manner such that the exercise of such
party’s procurement rights is a sham to affect the licensing of the Licensed Technology of
the other party or any portion thereof, to a third Person and not for bona fide business
purposes of Aurox Holdings.
(d) Aurox Holdings agrees that prior to the disclosure of any portion of Licensed
Technology of the other party under this Section 3.3, it shall expunge all extraneous
proprietary information of Aurox.
(e) Nothing in this Section 3.3 will be construed to obligate Aurox to transfer or provide
technical assistance to third Persons with respect to the Technology that it has licensed
under this Agreement.
3.4 Assignment of Technology Licenses. The license granted to Aurox Holdings under Section
3.2 are assignable by Aurox Holdings only to the acquirer of all or substantially all of the assets of
its business, and provided that: (a) all such licenses are assigned together (i.e., concurrently and to
the same assignee); (b) the assignee expressly assumes in writing acceptable to Aurox all
obligations and limitations under this Agreement with respect to such licenses; and (c) such
assigned licenses may be exercised by the assignee only in connection with (i) the operation of the
business and assets of Aurox Holdings so sold or disposed of, and (ii) with the authorization or
approval of any governmental authority as then may be required. Subject to the foregoing, the
Technology rights and licenses granted above shall continue in accordance their terms with respect
to the assignee as further set forth in Section 9.2(c). Any assignment or attempted assignment in
violation of the foregoing will be null and void.
4. PATENT, TRADEMARK OR COPYRIGHTED TECHNOLOGIES
4.1 Assignment of Rights to Aurox Holdings. Aurox hereby assigns any and all patent,
trademark or copyright rights to the Corporation Technology to Aurox Holdings.
4.2 Use of Protected Materials. Any US or international patent, trademark or copyright which
now or hereafter may be granted to Aurox with respect to the Aurox Technology is hereby licensed
to Aurox Holdings and made subject to this Agreement, without the necessity of further
consideration or agreement between Aurox and Aurox Holdings. Further assignment or sublicense
of any such patent, trademark or copyright is subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 3.4
E-6
hereof. Any assignment or attempted assignment of any such patent, trademark or copyright in
violation of Section 3.4 will be null and void.
5. RETENTION, MAINTENANCE AND DEFENSE OF RIGHTS
5.1 Retained Rights. Aurox grants no license (or makes any covenant not to assert) other than
as expressly set forth in Article 3 and Article 4. Subject only to such licenses and covenants, Aurox
retains all right, title and interest (including all Patents and Non-Patent Intellectual Property
Rights), in and to its Technology, Patents and Non-Patent Intellectual Property Rights. Without
limiting the foregoing, Aurox will have the sole right (but not the obligation) to file for, prosecute
and maintain any applications, registrations or recordation thereof and to bring any action to
enforce or otherwise seek to abate any infringement thereof.
5.2 No Representations or Warranties.
AUROX HOLDINGS ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT: (i) AUROX DOES NOT
MAKE IN THIS AGREEMENT (OR ANY OTHER AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE) ANY

5.3 Aurox Holdings Indemnification.
(a) Obligation to Defend – Subject to the limitations and exclusions stated below, Aurox
Holdings will defend, at its own expense, any Claim against Aurox, and will indemnify
and hold Aurox harmless from all Damages awarded in the Suit or resulting from
settlement of the Suit or any Claim. “Suit” means a lawsuit based on a Claim. For purposes
of this Section, “Claim” means a claim that a product or service furnished by Aurox
Holdings to a third Person on or after the Effective Date infringes a Patent or Non-Patent
Intellectual Property Right anywhere in the world.

shall:
(i) promptly notify Aurox in writing as soon as reasonably practicable after
Aurox Holdings first becomes aware of the Claim, and
(ii) give Aurox sole control of the Claim and all requested assistance for resolving
the Claim or defending the Suit.
Aurox will not be liable for the settlement of a Claim made without Aurox’s prior written consent
unless Aurox breaches its duty to defend hereunder. If any suit against Aurox Holdings involves a
Claim as well as other claims against Aurox, Aurox Holdings shall nonetheless be fully responsible
E-7
for defending, indemnifying and holding Aurox harmless from the Claim(s), and shall provide
reasonable cooperation to Aurox’s counsel with respect to the other claims asserted in such suit.
(c) Exclusions — Aurox Holdings will have no obligation to defend, indemnify or hold
Aurox harmless to the extent:
(i) Aurox or any third Person has altered the Aurox Technology, and the alleged
infringement would not have occurred but for this alteration; or
(ii) Aurox or any third Person has combined the Aurox Technology with any
other products or elements not furnished by Aurox Holdings, and the alleged
infringement would not have occurred but for this combination.
(d) Remedies – If the use or permitted resale of any Aurox Technology is enjoined as a
result of a Suit or in Aurox’s reasonable belief is likely to be enjoined, Aurox, at Aurox’s
option, and at no expense to Aurox Holdings, will: (i) obtain for Aurox Holdings the right
to use the Aurox Technology; (ii) modify the Aurox Technology to make it non-infringing
without degrading it, or (iii) substitute an equivalent non-infringing product(s) reasonably
acceptable to Aurox Holdings and extend this indemnity to that product(s).
(e) Limitations on Payable Damages – Aurox Holdings’ total liability for damages under
this Section 5.3, with respect to any Suit or Claim with respect to Aurox Technology will
not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the net license fees to Aurox of the applicable Aurox
Technology (as recorded in Aurox Holdings’ audited financial statements) for the period
of the alleged infringement, plus attorneys’ fees and costs related to such Claim.
(f) ENTIRE LIABILITY – THIS SECTION CONTAINS (I) AUROX HOLDINGS’
ENTIRE LIABILITY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL
PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION FOR AUROX HOLDINGS
INDEMNIFIED PRODUCTS, AND (II) AUROX’S EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES
AGAINST AUROX HOLDINGS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF AUROX TECHNOLOGY. THESE
REMEDIES ARE PROVIDED IN LIEU OF ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED
OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTY
AGAINST INFRINGEMENT SPECIFIED IN THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.
(g) WITHOUT LIMITATION OF AUROX’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS SECTION
5.3 WITH REGARD TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS AGAINST AUROX, IN NO EVENT
WILL AUROX HOLDINGS OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES BE LIABLE FOR ANY
OTHER SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL, CONSEQUENTIAL
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS OF AUROX OR ITS AFFILIATES,
HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, IN CONNECTION

7.2 will not apply with respect to any information that the Receiving Party can document: (a) is or
becomes generally available to the public through no improper action or inaction by the Receiving
Party or any of its Affiliates, agents, consultants or employees; or (b) was properly in the Receiving
Party’s possession or known by it prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; or (c) was rightfully
disclosed to the Receiving Party by a third Person provided the Receiving Party complies with
restrictions imposed by the third Person. The Receiving Party, with prior written notice to the
Disclosing Party, may disclose such Confidential Information to the minimum extent possible that
is required to be disclosed to a governmental entity or agency, or pursuant to the lawful
requirement or request of a governmental entity or agency, provided that reasonable measures are
taken to guard against further disclosure (including without limitation, seeking appropriate
confidential treatment or a protective order, or assisting the Disclosing Party to do so) and has
allowed the Disclosing Party to participate in any proceeding that requires the disclosure.

agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and

and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event of

Exhibits, and any other documents incorporated herein by reference, the following order
of precedence governs: (a) first, this Agreement, excluding its Exhibits; (b) second, the
Exhibits to this Agreement as of the Effective Date; and (c) third, any other documents
incorporated herein by reference.
(b) Notices. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and
other communications hereunder (each, a “Notice”) must be in writing and addressed to
the Parties at the addresses set forth on the signature page of this Agreement (or to such
other address that may be designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in
accordance with this Section). All Notices must be delivered by email (with confirmation
of transmission), or certified or registered mail (in each case, return receipt requested,
postage pre-paid). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, a Notice is effective
only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the Notice has
complied with the requirements of this Section.
(c) Amendment and Modification; Waiver. No amendment to or modification

representative of each Party. No waiver by any Party of any of the provisions hereof will
be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the Party so waiving. Except
as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (i) no failure to exercise, or delay in exercising,
any rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement will operate or be
construed as a waiver thereof and (ii) no single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power, or privilege hereunder will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
(d) Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or =enforceability will not
affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable

possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Nevada without giving effect
to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the
application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the State of Nevada. Any
legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or the licenses
granted hereunder will be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States
or the courts of the State of Texas, and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.

any of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by
operation of law, or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Licensor, which consent

transfer, or delegation in violation of this Section is null and void. No assignment, transfer,
or delegation will relieve the assigning or delegating Party of any of its obligations
hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon and inures to the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
(g) Equitable Relief. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or
threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under 5 or, in the case of Licensee,
Section 2(b), would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages
would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened
breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an
injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court,
without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or
that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and
are in addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.
(h) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which is deemed an original, but all of which together are deemed to be one and the same
